const handleSendToVocabMaster = async () => {
  const strugglingWords = filteredWords.filter(w => w.mastery_level === 'struggling');
  
  // Create assignment
  const { data: assignment, error } = await supabase
    .from('assignments')
    .insert({
      class_id: classId,
      title: `VocabMaster Review - ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}`,
      description: 'Personalized review of struggling words',
      game_type: 'vocab-master',
      vocabulary_ids: strugglingWords.map(w => w.vocabulary_id)
    })
    .select()
    .single();

  if (!error) {
