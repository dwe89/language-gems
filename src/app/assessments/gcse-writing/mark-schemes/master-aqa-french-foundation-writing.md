## PHOTO DESCRIPTION (Foundation) - Maximum 10 marks

### Official AQA Mark Scheme - Question 01 (Foundation)
**Maximum Marks: 10** (5 sentences × 2 marks each)


For this question, students are required to write five sentences to describe the photo. Each sentence is
marked separately and is worth a maximum of two marks, according to the following criteria. The whole
sentence should be considered when awarding the mark. The maximum mark for Question 1 is 10.

### MARKING CRITERIA PER SENTENCE:
- **2 Marks**: The relevant message is clearly communicated.
- **1 Mark**: The message is relevant but has some ambiguity and causes a delay in communication.
- **0 Marks**: The message is irrelevant or cannot be understood.

The grid below provides examples of short sentences that could be produced. Any combination of appropriate sentences is acceptable.

**2 marks**
- "Il y a une famille dans le parc" → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)
- "Le père joue avec le chien" → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)
- "Il fait du soleil" / "Il fait beau" → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)
- Il y a/Je vois neuf/9 personnes → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)
- La mère/Le père/Les enfants sont assis → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)
- La famille mange/est en train de manger → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)

**1 mark**
- "Dans le parc" → 1 mark (some ambiguity, no verb)
- "La famille heureuse" → 1 mark (some ambiguity, no verb)
- "Le père avec le chien" → 1 mark (some ambiguity, no verb)
- être dans une classe → 1 mark (verb not conjugated)
- une table → 1 mark (some ambiguity, no verb)

**0 marks**
- neuf → 0 marks (single word, no verb)
- chien → 0 marks (single word, no verb)
- étudier (alone) → 0 marks (single word, no verb)
- La famille le parc → 0 marks (unintelligible)
- Inappropriate verb + noun,
- je veux une table → 0 marks (irrelevant)
- No response → 0 marks



### CRITICAL GUIDANCE:
- ALL tenses are accepted
- MINOR errors (accents, gender, agreement, spelling) do NOT affect marks
- Only MAJOR errors that DESTROY communication should reduce marks
- Be GENEROUS - if in doubt, give the higher mark
- Short sentences are perfectly acceptable for full marks
- Students may use the same grammatical structure for each sentence if they wish. So, they could use 'il y a' in each sentence, for example. Il y a + noun is acceptable for full marks as long as the sentence is relevant and clear.

### Example Sentences:
- "Il y a une famille dans le parc" → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)
- "Le père joue" → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)
- "Il fait du soleil" → 2 marks (relevant, clear, conjugated verb)

Statements must refer to what is in the photo and cannot refer to what is not in it. ‘I like the photo’ and
similar opinions about the photo, without mentioning what is in it, will score 0. However, if the sentence
reads, for example, ‘I like the photo because it is sunny’, it will score 2 marks.
If the sentence could possibly be true or is very broadly relevant, accept it. For instance, it is acceptable
if the student writes ‘The car is green’, even though the photo is in black and white. However, if the
sentence is clearly false, it receives a mark of 0. For example, ‘There is a fish’, when there clearly isn’t
one.
It is acceptable to write a figure (eg ‘There are 2 people’) rather than a word. This is true of all questions
at both Foundation and Higher tiers.
The aim of this question is for students to write in the present tense, but other tenses are also
acceptable. For example, ‘The man was playing football’ is acceptable.

For 2 marks
- The response must be in the form of a sentence, using an appropriate conjugated verb. The same verb/grammatical structure may be repeated in more than one sentence, eg il y a plus different nouns.
- Any sentence that is broadly relevant to the photo is given 2 marks. For example, imagine that the photo is of a man in a café. The student writes, in the target language: It's a man. He's old (even if to your eyes he may not be – 'old' to a 16-year old may be different from your perception of 'old'). He's a father (even if this is not apparent from the photo, it could potentially be true). He's a teacher (again this potentially could be true). Each of these sentences would be awarded 2 marks.
- The first person and second person of the verb is acceptable, for example: 'I am/we are/you are playing tennis'.
- There may be linguistic errors, but the message must be communicated without ambiguity.

For 1 mark
- The use of an infinitive in an otherwise appropriate response.
- Language error(s) causing ambiguity or a delay in communication, for example: 'They are eating coffee'.
- A delay in communication because the response is too long, where one part communicates well but another part does not, for example: 'There is a family and they are a park'.
For 0 marks
- The message makes no sense.
- An inappropriate verb is used, for example 'I would like a house'.
- A single word which is not a conjugated verb

## TRANSLATION (English → French) - Maximum 10 marks

### Official AQA Mark Scheme - Foundation Translation
**Maximum Marks: 10**

For this question there are five compulsory bullet points, which are assessed for AO2 (5 marks) and AO3 (5 marks), as specified in the criteria below. The maximum mark for Question 2 is 10. The student is expected to produce approximately 50 words over the whole question. The number of words is approximate and you must mark all work produced by the student, even if it is well beyond the suggested number of words

### GRID ONE: (Maximum 5 marks)

| Level | Mark AO2 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 5 | • All five bullet points are covered. • Communication is clear. |
| 4 | 4 | • At least four bullet points are covered. • Communication is mostly clear. There are occasional lapses in clarity. |
| 3 | 3 | • At least three bullet points are covered. • Communication is generally clear. There are several lapses in clarity. |
| 2 | 2 | • At least two bullet points are covered. • Communication is sometimes clear. There are regular lapses in clarity. |
| 1 | 1 | • At least one bullet point is covered. • Communication is often not clear. There are many lapses in clarity. |
| 0 | 0 | The content does not meet the standard required for a mark at this tier. 

Notes
• All bullet points are compulsory and must be covered, but there is no need for equal coverage of the
bullet points.
• When awarding a mark, all aspects of the descriptors must be considered and not only the number
of bullet points covered.
Guidance for examiners
• The student’s response must be relevant to the bullet points. Any information which cannot be
deemed relevant must be ignored when awarding a mark for AO2.
• The information that the student gives must be clear. If what is written is unclear, this will have a
bearing on the mark for AO2. For example, the student may convey information in relation to all five
bullet points, but lapses in clarity may mean that a lower mark than 5 is more appropriate. The more
lapses in clarity that there are, the lower the mark is likely to be. All of the information that a student
attempts to give in relation to a particular bullet point may be unintelligible, in which case that bullet
point will not have been covered, meaning that a mark of 5 will be impossible, as the response will not
display full coverage of the required information.
• There is no requirement in this question for the student to refer to events in the past or future, so using
the present tense only will enable coverage of the bullet points. However, the bullet points tend to be
general and so references to the past or to the future are acceptable. For example, if the bullet point
says ‘Holidays’, the student may choose to write about a past or future holiday.

• There is no requirement for students to present their piece of writing in a particular way because of the
context, eg a blog or email does not need to look like a blog or email. It is the content which is to be
marked.

### GRID TWO: (Maximum 5 marks)

| Level | Mark AO3 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 5 | • There is a variety of vocabulary and grammatical structures. • There may be some errors, but these are minor. |
| 4 | 4 | • There is some variety of vocabulary and grammatical structures. • There are frequent minor errors but with an occasional major error. |
| 3 | 3 | • There is some attempt at a variety of vocabulary and grammatical structures. • There are frequent minor errors, together with some major errors. |
| 2 | 2 | • There is use of limited or repetitive vocabulary and grammatical structures. • There are frequent minor errors and a number of major errors. |
| 1 | 1 | • There is little awareness of appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures. • There are errors in the vast majority of sentences. |
| 0 | 0 | The language does not meet the standard required for Level 1 at this tier.
Notes
- A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3, but, apart from that, the AO2 mark does not limit the mark for AO3.
- A major error is one which adversely affects communication.
- A minor error is one which does not affect communication.
Guidance for examiners
• The whole of the response must be assessed when awarding the mark for AO3, even if some of it is
irrelevant to the bullet points. There are no dependencies between the two sets of criteria.
• Once you have decided on the mark for AO2, you should read through the response once more and
decide on the mark for AO3. Each level has two strands: variety of vocabulary and structures and
accuracy of the language. Sometimes it will be necessary to adopt a ‘best fit’ approach, because the
two strands will not be consistently demonstrated. So, for example, the writing may be very accurate,
but the vocabulary and structures are so repetitive that a mark of 3 is more appropriate than a mark of
4 or 5.
• This mark is not limited by the mark for AO2, unless the mark for AO2 is 0, in which case the mark for
AO3 must also be 0.
• However, sometimes a student may only attempt one or two of the bullets in a very short piece of
writing or they may answer all of them very briefly, using four or five words. Even if this writing is totally
accurate with appropriate vocabulary and structures, a high mark for AO3 would be improbable
because of the lack of linguistic variety.
• Variety of language will be shown through, for example, different adjectives; different persons of the
verb; some variety in the nouns and verbs used. 

Glossary
The following glossary provides some guidance on terms used within the descriptors.
Lapse in clarity Use of language that causes a delay in communication. For example:
Mon écol est grande.
J'aime le football. C'est ennuyeux.
Le soir je prends mon petit déjeuner à douze heures.
Major error An error which adversely affects communication.
Some examples are:
Incorrect verb forms.
Incorrect use of pronoun.
Examples of major errors:
Tu aimes le sport for J'aime le sport.
Hier je mange un sandwich.
Minor error An error which does not affect communication.
Some examples are:
Incorrect but close to correct spellings.
Incorrect genders and errors of agreement.
Incorrect or missing accents unless these alter the meaning.
Examples of minor errors:
Mon collège est petite.
Mes proffesseurs sont intéressant.
Variety of language Some examples:
Different ways of expressing opinions – j'aime/j’adore/je préfère,
c'est super/génial/excellent
Use of intensifiers.
Different persons of the verb.
Several successful examples of this would be considered as ‘a variety’.
A few successful examples of this would be considered to be ‘some
variety’.
A few examples that are not always successful of this would be
considered to be ‘some attempt at variety’. For example: ‘j’aime regarde
la télé’.
A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3, but, apart from that, the AO2
mark does not limit the mark for AO3. For example:
• If a student has only addressed 3 bullet points but has produced a response that includes a variety of
appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures with very few errors, a mark of 3+5 is possible.
• If a student has clearly addressed all 5 bullet points but has produced a response that includes some
attempt at a variety of appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures but with frequent minor
errors and some major errors, a mark of 5+3 is possible.

Below is some guidance on the specific bullet points included in the question:

| Bullet | Comments |
|--------|----------|
| sport | Accept any comment about sport, including watching or participating. Accept any tense. |
| music | Accept any comment about musical tastes/listening to music/playing music. Accept any tense. |
| television | Accept any comment about television. Accept the English names of TV programmes, references to Netflix and/or other streaming services. Accept playing videogames on TV. Accept any tense. |
| reading | Accept any comment about reading. Accept any tense. |
| cinema | Accept any comment about cinema, as a venue or a medium. Accept any tense.
The following indicative content is an example of the response that students may give to this question. It
would be awarded full marks.

- EXEMPLAR RESPONSE

J'aime le tennis et je joue avec mes amis le samedi. Je cours et je nage aussi. J'écoute de la musique
quand j'étudie dans ma chambre. Je ne regarde pas beaucoup la télé, je préfère regarder Netflix sur mon ordinateur. J'adore lire, c'est mon activité préférée. Je ne vais pas souvent au cinéma parce que c'est très cher.
(50+ words)
[10 marks]


Q3 - Grammar Gap-Fill - Maximum 10 marks

### Official AQA Mark Scheme - Question 03 (Foundation)


The following table shows the marks available for each part of the question.

Students are required to complete five sentences by writing the correct word to complete the short
sentence, using their knowledge of grammar. There are three words to choose from for each of the five
sentences. There are 5 marks for AO3. 

Q4 - Translation (English → French) - Maximum 10 marks

Question 04
The translation is assessed for AO3 (10 marks) as specified in the criteria below. The maximum mark for
Question 3 is 10. When awarding the marks for Grid One and Grid Two, the student’s response across
all five sentences should be considered as a whole.
When awarding the mark for Grid One out of a maximum of five, the translation is divided into 15
elements as shown in the grid on page 13. A tick will be awarded for each element that is
communicated, despite any minor inaccuracies. The number of ticks out of 15 in column 2 of Grid One
below equates to a mark out of five in column 3.
Grid One: Rendering of the original meaning

| Level | Number of ticks credited | Marks AO3 | Description |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 5 | 13-15 | 5 | The meanings of all or nearly all elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 4 | 10-12 | 4 | The meanings of most elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 3 | 7-9 | 3 | The meanings of some elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 2 | 4-6 | 2 | The meanings of few elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 1 | 1-3 | 1 | The meanings of very few elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | No elements of the meanings of the original language are conveyed.
Once the mark for Grid One is awarded, a mark out of five is awarded for Grid Two. This mark is based
on the student’s response across all five sentences as a whole.

Grid Two: Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar

| Level | Marks AO3 | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 5 | 5 | • Very good knowledge of the required vocabulary. Few if any inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is highly accurate and any errors that occur are only minor. |
| 4 | 4 | • Good knowledge of vocabulary. Some inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is generally accurate with regular minor errors. |
| 3 | 3 | • Satisfactory knowledge of vocabulary. Regular inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is more accurate than inaccurate. Regular major and minor errors. |
| 2 | 2 | • Limited knowledge of vocabulary. Many inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is generally inaccurate. Many major and minor errors |
| 1 | 1 | • Very limited knowledge of vocabulary. Few appropriate items. • Grammar is highly inaccurate. Major and minor errors in all or almost all sentences. |
| 0 | 0 | The language produced does not meet the standard required for Level 1 at this tier.
Notes
- A mark of zero in Grid One automatically results in a mark of zero in Grid Two, but apart from that, the Rendering of original meaning mark does not limit the mark for Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar.
- A major error is one which adversely affects communication.
- A minor error is one which does not affect communication.
Guidance for examiners
When deciding on whether an element is conveyed, you should ask yourself the question: ‘Would a
native speaker understand the target language version without reference to the original English?’ If the
answer is ‘yes’, award a tick.
A major error is an error which adversely affects communication. Some examples are:
Incorrect verb forms.
Incorrect use of pronouns.
Examples of major errors:
Tu aimes le sport for J'aime le sport.
Hier je mange un sandwich.

A minor error is an error which does not affect communication. Some examples are:
Incorrect but close to correct spellings.
Incorrect genders and errors of agreement.
Incorrect or missing accents unless these alter the meaning.
Examples of minor errors:
Mon collège est petite.
Mes proffesseurs sont intéressant.

Other reasonable alternative renderings of the original meaning will also be accepted. However, verbs in
the wrong tense and/or person will not be credited/accepted.
Once you have decided on the mark for Grid One, you should read through the translation once more
and decide on the mark out of 5 for Grid Two.
This mark is not limited by the mark for Grid One, unless the mark is zero, in which case the mark for
Grid Two must also be zero.
If a student leaves gaps, you must assume that any attempt would have been highly inaccurate and take
this into account when awarding marks in Grid Two. Not to do so will penalise unfairly those students
who make an attempt but commit serious errors in so doing.
Perfection is not required for full marks. For example, occasional missing accents and minor spelling
errors do not preclude a top band mark. However, if there are numerous minor errors and incorrect use
of accents which change the meaning of a word, this is likely to have an impact on the mark for Grid
Two, knowledge of vocabulary and grammar

Question 05 - extended writing - Maximum 15 marks

Question 05
For this question, there are three compulsory bullet points which are assessed for AO2 (10 marks) and
AO3 (5 marks), as specified in the criteria below. The maximum mark for Question 5 is 15.
The student is expected to produce approximately 90 words for this task. The number of words is
approximate and demonstration of the mark descriptors is more important than the word count. You must
mark all work produced by the student, even if it is well beyond the suggested number of words.
All bullet points must be covered, but there is no need for equal coverage of the bullet points.
| Level | Mark AO2 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 9-10 | • All three bullet points are covered. • Communication is clear. • Ideas are regularly developed with a lot of relevant information being conveyed. |
| 4 | 7-8 | • All three bullet points are covered. • Communication is mostly clear but perhaps with occasional lapses in clarity. • Ideas are often developed with quite a lot of relevant information being conveyed. |
| 3 | 5-6 | • At least two bullet points are covered. • Communication is generally clear but there are likely to be lapses in clarity. • A few ideas may be developed and some relevant information is conveyed. |
| 2 | 3-4 | • At least one bullet point is covered. • Communication is sometimes clear and there are regular lapses in clarity. • Little relevant information is conveyed. |
| 1 | 1-2 | • At least one bullet point is covered. • Communication is often not clear and there are very many lapses in clarity. • Very little relevant information is conveyed. |
| 0 | 0 | The content does not meet the standard required for a mark at this tier.

Notes
- There may be some imbalance in the coverage of the three compulsory bullet points but, provided at least some coverage of all bullet points is evident, students will have access to full marks where the other criteria are met.
- When awarding a mark, all aspects of the descriptors must be considered and not only the number of bullet points covered.

Guidance for examiners
- The information that the student gives must be clear. If what is written is unclear, this will have a bearing on the mark for AO2. For example, the student may convey information in relation to all three bullet points, but lapses in clarity may mean that a lower mark than the 9 or 10 is more appropriate. The more lapses in clarity that there are, the lower the mark is likely to be. All of the information that a student attempts to give in relation to a particular bullet point may be unintelligible, in which case that bullet point will not have been covered, meaning that the maximum mark will be 6.
- You must accept any information which is a plausible response to the bullet point, even if it does not explicitly mention, for instance, a time or place. For example, if the bullet asks what the student did last weekend, and he/she writes 'I went to see my aunt and then went to the cinema', this can feasibly be an account of what happened last weekend, even though 'last weekend' is not mentioned. Equally, if the student is asked to say what he/she does on a typical visit to a shopping centre and they write 'I buy some clothes and go to see a film', this is also an acceptable fulfilment of the task, even though 'shopping centre' is not mentioned.
- The levels refer to the amount of information that is conveyed, as follows: 9 – 10: a lot 7 – 8: quite a lot 5 – 6: some 3 – 4: little 1 – 2: very little All of these have to be considered with reference to the suggested number of words, which is approximately 90. In other words, a student who writes approximately 90 words, clearly understandable and relevant to all three bullet points, will be able to achieve 10 marks, provided the other criteria are met. Conversely, a student may write much more than 90 words, but the language is so inaccurate that little or very little information is conveyed successfully and the mark will be much lower. If a student writes considerably fewer than 90 words, 'a lot of information' will not be conveyed.
- When deciding a particular mark, it is advisable to identify the level of marks first, and then consider how close the response is to the level above or to the level below. This will enable you to award an appropriate mark within the level. For example, if the response is closer to the descriptors in the level above, you would award the higher of the two marks in the level.

| Level | Mark AO3 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 5 | • A good variety of vocabulary is used. • There are regular attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to all three time frames which are mainly successful. • Any errors are mainly minor but some major errors may occur, particularly in complex structures and sentences. |
| 4 | 4 | • A variety of vocabulary is used. • There are some attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to at least two different time frames which are mainly successful. • Errors are mainly minor but some major errors may occur. |
| 3 | 3 | • Some variety of vocabulary is used. • There may be occasional attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to at least two different time frames, although these may not always be successful. • There may be some major errors, and minor errors occur regularly but overall the response is more accurate than inaccurate. |
| 2 | 2 | • A limited variety of vocabulary is used. • The language is mainly simple but there may be some attempts at longer sentences with appropriate linking words. • There may be no successful references to different time frames. • There may be frequent major and minor errors and overall the response is generally inaccurate. |
| 1 | 1 | • The range of vocabulary is narrow and/or repetitive. • The language is simple and sentences are short or may not be properly constructed. • There are no successful references to different time frames. • There may be frequent major and minor errors and overall the response is highly inaccurate. |
| 0 | 0 | The language does not meet the standard required for Level 1 at this tier.

Notes
• A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3. Apart from that, the AO2
mark does not limit the mark for AO3.
• A major error is one which adversely affects communication.
• A minor error is one which does not affect communication

Guidance for examiners
A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3. Apart from that, the AO2 mark
does not limit the mark for AO3. For example:
• If a student has only addressed 2 bullet points clearly but has produced a response that includes a
good variety of vocabulary, regular attempts at complexity of language and structure, successful
references to all three time frames with errors that are mainly minor and some major errors in
complex structures and sentences, then a mark of 6+5 is possible.
• If a student has clearly addressed all 3 bullet points but has produced a response with some variety
of appropriate vocabulary, occasional attempts at complexity of language and structure, references
to at least two different time frames, with some major errors and minor errors occurring regularly,
then a mark of 10+3 is possible.
Once you have decided on the mark for AO2, you should read through the response once more and
decide on the mark for AO3. A mark of 0 for AO2 automatically results in a mark of 0 for AO3 but, apart
from that, the mark for AO2 does not limit the mark for AO3. However, a short piece is unlikely to
demonstrate sufficient variety for a high mark for AO3.
The whole of the response must be assessed when awarding the mark for AO3, even if some of it is
irrelevant to the bullet points.
The following points should be taken into account when deciding on the mark to be awarded:
• Each level has four strands: variety of vocabulary; complexity of structures and sentences; reference
to time frames; accuracy of the language. Sometimes it will be necessary to adopt a ‘best fit’
approach, because the four strands will not be consistently demonstrated.
• In order to score 5 marks, there must be reference to all three time frames (past, present and future).
For 4 marks, there must be reference to at least two time frames. Reference to a particular time frame
may be demonstrated with one example. The verb used to refer to a particular time frame need not be
totally correct, provided the message is clear. These marks are not awarded automatically and the
other criteria in the level are equally important. Notice that references are to time frames, not tenses.
So, for example, the present tense usage in the following sentence is a reference to a future time
frame: ‘I’m going to the concert next week’.
• When considering the complexity of the language, you should bear in mind that a) this is the overlap
question and is attempted by both Foundation and Higher students; b) that the criteria for AO3 in this
question are not as demanding as the language criteria for Higher Question 3. However, for a mark of
3, 4 or 5, complex structures and sentences are attempted. They may not always be successful and
this may lead to serious errors because of the complexity of the structure or sentence which the
student attempts. Complexity may be shown in some of the following ways: different tenses; time
markers; connectives; subordinate clauses; infinitive constructions. This should not be seen as a ‘tick
list’, but rather as an indication of the definition of complexity at GCSE level.
• There is no requirement for students to present their piece of writing in a particular way because of the
context, eg a blog or email does not need to look like a blog or email. It is the content which is to be
marked

Ma ville est beaucoup plus petite que Leeds mais je l'adore parce qu'elle est jolie et tous mes amis
habitent tout près. Le problème, c'est qu'il n'y a pas grand-chose à faire. La semaine dernière, je suis allé à Leeds avec mes
amis. Les magasins là-bas sont super et nous avons acheté beaucoup de choses. Nous avons mangé dans un restaurant
où les plats sont délicieux. Le soir, nous avons regardé Top Gun au cinéma. Je l'ai aimé. Cette année
nous avons de très longues vacances et nous allons visiter l'Espagne pour la première fois. Il va faire chaud et
ce sera amusant.

chambre et nous avons un jardin où je peux jouer le footbal avec ma soeur. Ma ville s'appelle
Walkington et c'est plusieurs magasins et un bar. Ce n'est pas loin de Beverley qui est une ville belle. Année
dernier je suis allé à un musée intéressant avec mon collége. Nous allons aller à l'étranger en vacances. Notre
hôtel est près de la plage. S'il fait beau, je vais nage dans la mer tous les jours.

AO2
All three bullet points are covered. Communication is mostly clear with occasional lapses in clarity:
parce que c'est ma propre chambre; c'est plusieurs magasins et un bar. Ideas are often developed especially in the
responses to bullets two and three. This places the work at level 4 (7 – 8 marks). Since a lot of
information, rather than quite a lot, is conveyed the work is closer to the level above than the level below,
so a mark of 8 is awarded.
AO3
A variety of appropriate vocabulary is used (propre, plusieurs, loin de, belle, tous les jours). There is
successful use of infinitive constructions, use of a relative clause introduced by qui, a weather
expression with faire and an ‘if’ clause in the final sentence. There is one past tense, various
present tenses and two attempts at a future reference, the first accurate, the second not. Errors are
mainly minor: slips in spelling and a lack of adjectival agreement, c'est is twice used instead of il y a. This
places the work at level 4 and it is awarded 4 marks.
This response is awarded 12 marks out of a possible 15 marks.
