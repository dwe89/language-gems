# AQA GCSE French Higher Writing - Master Mark Scheme

## Overview
This mark scheme provides detailed grading criteria for AQA GCSE French Higher tier writing assessments. It ensures consistent, fair, and accurate marking across all question types.

## Question Types Covered
- Translation (English → French)
- Extened Writing  90 words
- Extended Writing 150 words

---

Q1 - Translation (English → French) 10 marks

Section A
Question 01
The translation is assessed for AO3 (10 marks) as specified in the criteria below. The maximum mark for
Question 1 is 10. When awarding the marks for Grid One and Grid Two, the student’s response across
all five sentences should be considered as a whole.
When awarding the mark for Grid One out of a maximum of five, the translation is divided into 15
elements as shown in the grid on page 7. A tick will be awarded for each element that is communicated,
despite any minor inaccuracies. The number of ticks out of 15 in column 2 of Grid One below equates to
a mark out of five in column 3.
Grid One: Rendering of the original meaning

| Level | Number of ticks credited | Marks AO3 | Description |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 5 | 13-15 | 5 | The meanings of all or nearly all elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 4 | 10-12 | 4 | The meanings of most elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 3 | 7-9 | 3 | The meanings of some elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 2 | 4-6 | 2 | The meanings of few elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 1 | 1-3 | 1 | The meanings of very few elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | No elements of the meanings of the original language are conveyed.
Once the mark for Grid One is awarded, a mark out of five is awarded for Grid Two. This mark is based
on the student’s response across all five sentences as a whole.
Grid Two: Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar

| Level | Marks AO3 | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 5 | 5 | • Very good knowledge of the required vocabulary. Few if any inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is highly accurate and any errors that occur are only minor. |
| 4 | 4 | • Good knowledge of vocabulary. Some inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is generally accurate with regular minor errors. |
| 3 | 3 | • Satisfactory knowledge of vocabulary. Regular inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is more accurate than inaccurate. Regular major and minor errors. |
| 2 | 2 | • Limited knowledge of vocabulary. Many inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is generally inaccurate. Many major and minor errors. |
| 1 | 1 | • Very limited knowledge of vocabulary. Few appropriate items. • Grammar is highly inaccurate. Major and minor errors in all or almost all sentences. |
| 0 | 0 | The language produced does not meet the standard required for Level 1 at this tier.
Notes
- A mark of zero in Grid One automatically results in a mark of zero in Grid Two, but apart from that, the Rendering of original meaning mark does not limit the mark for Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar.
- A major error is one which adversely affects communication.
- A minor error is one which does not affect communication.
Guidance for Examiners
When deciding on whether an element is conveyed, you should ask yourself the question: ‘Would a
native speaker understand the target language version without reference to the original English?’ If the
answer is ‘yes’, award a tick.
A major error is an error which adversely affects communication. Some examples are:
Incorrect verb forms.
Incorrect use of pronouns.
Examples of major errors:
Tu aimes le sport for J'aime le sport.
Hier je mange un sandwich.
A minor error is an error which does not affect communication. Some examples are:
Incorrect but close to correct spellings.
Incorrect genders and errors of agreement.
Incorrect or missing accents unless these alter the meaning.
Examples of minor errors:
Mon collège est petite.
Mes proffesseurs sont intéressant

| Element of original language | Indicative content | Alternative acceptable renderings | Reject |
|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------|
| 1 | I went to school | Je suis allé au collège | Je suis allé à l'école | Je suis allé collège etc. |
| 2 | on the bus | en bus | en autocar |  |
| 3 | this morning. | ce matin. |  | matin [alone] |
| 4 | I am going to spend | Je vais passer | Je passerai |  |
| 5 | three days at | trois jours à |  |  |
| 6 | my aunt's house. | la maison de ma tante. | chez ma tante | ma tante's maison |
| 7 | My sister eats | Ma sœur mange |  |  |
| 8 | too much fast food, | trop de fast-food / cuisine rapide | trop de la nourriture rapide |  |
| 9 | but I try | mais j'essaie | je tente / j'essaye |  |
| 10 | to avoid it. | de l'éviter. |  | Pronoun le/la placed before essaie |
| 11 | I used to play basketball | Je jouais au basket | je faisais du basket |  |
| 12 | every week | chaque semaine | toutes les semaines |  |
| 13 | when I was younger. | quand j'étais plus jeune. | quand j'étais petit(e). |  |
| 14 | We have just seen | Nous venons de voir | on vient de voir |  |
| 15 | our new teacher. | notre nouveau professeur. | notre nouvelle professeure. |  |
Other reasonable alternative renderings of the original meaning will also be accepted. However, verbs in
the wrong tense and/or person will not be credited/accepted.
Once you have decided on the mark for Grid One, you should read through the translation once more
and decide on the mark out of 5 for Grid Two.
This mark is not limited by the mark for Grid One, unless the mark is zero, in which case the mark for
Grid Two must also be zero.
If a student leaves gaps, you must assume that any attempt would have been highly inaccurate and take
this into account when awarding marks in Grid Two. Not to do so will penalise unfairly those students
who make an attempt but commit serious errors in so doing.
Perfection is not required for full marks. For example, occasional missing accents and minor spelling
errors do not preclude a top band mark. However, if there are numerous minor errors and incorrect use
of accents which change the meaning of a word, this is likely to have an impact on the mark for Grid
Two, knowledge of vocabulary and grammar.


Q2 - Extended Writing 90 words

Question 05 - extended writing - Maximum 15 marks

Question 05
For this question, there are three compulsory bullet points which are assessed for AO2 (10 marks) and
AO3 (5 marks), as specified in the criteria below. The maximum mark for Question 5 is 15.
The student is expected to produce approximately 90 words for this task. The number of words is
approximate and demonstration of the mark descriptors is more important than the word count. You must
mark all work produced by the student, even if it is well beyond the suggested number of words.
All bullet points must be covered, but there is no need for equal coverage of the bullet points.
| Level | Mark AO2 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 9-10 | • All three bullet points are covered. • Communication is clear. • Ideas are regularly developed with a lot of relevant information being conveyed. |
| 4 | 7-8 | • All three bullet points are covered. • Communication is mostly clear but perhaps with occasional lapses in clarity. • Ideas are often developed with quite a lot of relevant information being conveyed. |
| 3 | 5-6 | • At least two bullet points are covered. • Communication is generally clear but there are likely to be lapses in clarity. • A few ideas may be developed and some relevant information is conveyed. |
| 2 | 3-4 | • At least one bullet point is covered. • Communication is sometimes clear and there are regular lapses in clarity. • Little relevant information is conveyed. |
| 1 | 1-2 | • At least one bullet point is covered. • Communication is often not clear and there are very many lapses in clarity. • Very little relevant information is conveyed. |
| 0 | 0 | The content does not meet the standard required for a mark at this tier.

Notes
- There may be some imbalance in the coverage of the three compulsory bullet points but, provided at least some coverage of all bullet points is evident, students will have access to full marks where the other criteria are met.
- When awarding a mark, all aspects of the descriptors must be considered and not only the number of bullet points covered.

Guidance for examiners
- The information that the student gives must be clear. If what is written is unclear, this will have a bearing on the mark for AO2. For example, the student may convey information in relation to all three bullet points, but lapses in clarity may mean that a lower mark than the 9 or 10 is more appropriate. The more lapses in clarity that there are, the lower the mark is likely to be. All of the information that a student attempts to give in relation to a particular bullet point may be unintelligible, in which case that bullet point will not have been covered, meaning that the maximum mark will be 6.
- You must accept any information which is a plausible response to the bullet point, even if it does not explicitly mention, for instance, a time or place. For example, if the bullet asks what the student did last weekend, and he/she writes 'I went to see my aunt and then went to the cinema', this can feasibly be an account of what happened last weekend, even though 'last weekend' is not mentioned. Equally, if the student is asked to say what he/she does on a typical visit to a shopping centre and they write 'I buy some clothes and go to see a film', this is also an acceptable fulfilment of the task, even though 'shopping centre' is not mentioned.
- The levels refer to the amount of information that is conveyed, as follows: 9 – 10: a lot 7 – 8: quite a lot 5 – 6: some 3 – 4: little 1 – 2: very little All of these have to be considered with reference to the suggested number of words, which is approximately 90. In other words, a student who writes approximately 90 words, clearly understandable and relevant to all three bullet points, will be able to achieve 10 marks, provided the other criteria are met. Conversely, a student may write much more than 90 words, but the language is so inaccurate that little or very little information is conveyed successfully and the mark will be much lower. If a student writes considerably fewer than 90 words, 'a lot of information' will not be conveyed.
- When deciding a particular mark, it is advisable to identify the level of marks first, and then consider how close the response is to the level above or to the level below. This will enable you to award an appropriate mark within the level. For example, if the response is closer to the descriptors in the level above, you would award the higher of the two marks in the level.

| Level | Mark AO3 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 5 | • A good variety of vocabulary is used. • There are regular attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to all three time frames which are mainly successful. • Any errors are mainly minor but some major errors may occur, particularly in complex structures and sentences. |
| 4 | 4 | • A variety of vocabulary is used. • There are some attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to at least two different time frames which are mainly successful. • Errors are mainly minor but some major errors may occur. |
| 3 | 3 | • Some variety of vocabulary is used. • There may be occasional attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to at least two different time frames, although these may not always be successful. • There may be some major errors, and minor errors occur regularly but overall the response is more accurate than inaccurate. |
| 2 | 2 | • A limited variety of vocabulary is used. • The language is mainly simple but there may be some attempts at longer sentences with appropriate linking words. • There may be no successful references to different time frames. • There may be frequent major and minor errors and overall the response is generally inaccurate. |
| 1 | 1 | • The range of vocabulary is narrow and/or repetitive. • The language is simple and sentences are short or may not be properly constructed. • There are no successful references to different time frames. • There may be frequent major and minor errors and overall the response is highly inaccurate. |
| 0 | 0 | The language does not meet the standard required for Level 1 at this tier.

Notes
• A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3. Apart from that, the AO2
mark does not limit the mark for AO3.
• A major error is one which adversely affects communication.
• A minor error is one which does not affect communication

Guidance for examiners
A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3. Apart from that, the AO2 mark
does not limit the mark for AO3. For example:
• If a student has only addressed 2 bullet points clearly but has produced a response that includes a
good variety of vocabulary, regular attempts at complexity of language and structure, successful
references to all three time frames with errors that are mainly minor and some major errors in
complex structures and sentences, then a mark of 6+5 is possible.
• If a student has clearly addressed all 3 bullet points but has produced a response with some variety
of appropriate vocabulary, occasional attempts at complexity of language and structure, references
to at least two different time frames, with some major errors and minor errors occurring regularly,
then a mark of 10+3 is possible.
Once you have decided on the mark for AO2, you should read through the response once more and
decide on the mark for AO3. A mark of 0 for AO2 automatically results in a mark of 0 for AO3 but, apart
from that, the mark for AO2 does not limit the mark for AO3. However, a short piece is unlikely to
demonstrate sufficient variety for a high mark for AO3.
The whole of the response must be assessed when awarding the mark for AO3, even if some of it is
irrelevant to the bullet points.
The following points should be taken into account when deciding on the mark to be awarded:
• Each level has four strands: variety of vocabulary; complexity of structures and sentences; reference
to time frames; accuracy of the language. Sometimes it will be necessary to adopt a ‘best fit’
approach, because the four strands will not be consistently demonstrated.
• In order to score 5 marks, there must be reference to all three time frames (past, present and future).
For 4 marks, there must be reference to at least two time frames. Reference to a particular time frame
may be demonstrated with one example. The verb used to refer to a particular time frame need not be
totally correct, provided the message is clear. These marks are not awarded automatically and the
other criteria in the level are equally important. Notice that references are to time frames, not tenses.
So, for example, the present tense usage in the following sentence is a reference to a future time
frame: ‘I’m going to the concert next week’.
• When considering the complexity of the language, you should bear in mind that a) this is the overlap
question and is attempted by both Foundation and Higher students; b) that the criteria for AO3 in this
question are not as demanding as the language criteria for Higher Question 3. However, for a mark of
3, 4 or 5, complex structures and sentences are attempted. They may not always be successful and
this may lead to serious errors because of the complexity of the structure or sentence which the
student attempts. Complexity may be shown in some of the following ways: different tenses; time
markers; connectives; subordinate clauses; infinitive constructions. This should not be seen as a ‘tick
list’, but rather as an indication of the definition of complexity at GCSE level.
• There is no requirement for students to present their piece of writing in a particular way because of the
context, eg a blog or email does not need to look like a blog or email. It is the content which is to be
marked

Glossary
The following glossary provides some guidance on terms used within the descriptors.
Lapse in clarity Use of language that causes a delay in communication. For example:
Mon écol est grande.
J'aime le football. C'est ennuyeux.
Le soir je prends mon petit déjeuner à douze heures.
Major error An error which adversely affects communication.
Some examples are:
Incorrect verb forms.
Incorrect use of pronouns.
Examples of major errors:
Tu aimes le sport for J'aime le sport.
Hier je mange un sandwich.

Some examples are:
Incorrect but close to correct spellings.
Incorrect genders and errors of agreement.
Incorrect or missing accents unless these alter the meaning.
Examples of minor errors:

Variety of language Some examples:
Different ways of expressing opinions – j'aime/j’adore/je préfère,
c'est super/génial/excellent
Use of intensifiers.
Different persons of the verb.
Complexity of
language and
structure
Some examples are:
use of infinitive constructions introduced by prepositions (pour, sans),
adjectives (c'est difficile, c'est possible), and after verbs (je préfère aller, j'aime
étudier, il faut travailler, ça vaut la peine de visiter) and the modal verbs
devoir, pouvoir, vouloir, savoir, devoir.

use of indefinite pronouns/adjectives such as quelque chose, chaque, etc.
use of connectives such as bien que, à cause de, de plus
use of adverbs and adverbial phrases such as à part, cependant,
après, hier soir, par exemple, finalement, toujours.
use of negatives (eg ne … rien/personne/jamais/aucun).

moins…que, aussi… comme and meilleur(es)/pire(s)
use of demonstrative adjectives (ce, cette, ces).
use of a range of tenses (eg Passé Composé, Imparfait, Futur Proche (aller +
Infinitive)).
use of subordinate clauses introduced by eg parce que, c'est pourquoi, si.

use of relative clauses introduced by que, qui.
use of coordinating conjunctions: alors, ou, ensuite, mais (when using
longer sentences).
Question 05.1
Below is some guidance on the specific bullet points included in the question:

| Bullet | Comments |
|--------|----------|
| what you think of the place where you live | Accept one opinion on house/home town/home region/home country |
| a recent trip you went on | Accept one statement referring to any trip, home or away Accept any past time reference |
| what you would like to do in the summer holidays this year. | Accept one statement referring to any holiday plans Accept any future time reference No direct reference to 'summer'/'holidays'/'this year' required |
The following indicative content is an example of the response that students may give to this question. It
demonstrates a balanced coverage of the compulsory bullet points. It would be awarded full marks.
Ma ville est beaucoup plus petite que Leeds mais je l'adore parce qu'elle est jolie et tous mes amis
habitent tout près. Le problème, c'est qu'il n'y a pas grand-chose à faire. La semaine dernière, je suis allé à Leeds avec mes
amis. Les magasins là-bas sont super et nous avons acheté beaucoup de choses. Nous avons mangé dans un restaurant
où les plats sont délicieux. Le soir, nous avons regardé Top Gun au cinéma. Je l'ai aimé. Cette année
nous avons de très longues vacances et nous allons visiter l'Espagne pour la première fois. Il va faire chaud et
ce sera amusant.
(95 words)
[15 marks]
The following indicative content is an example of a response displaying some imbalance in the coverage
of the compulsory bullet points, although all three bullet points are covered.
J'habite dans une maison très beau avec ma famille. J'aime beaucoup habiter ici parce que c'est ma propre
chambre et nous avons un jardin où je peux jouer le footbal avec ma soeur. Ma ville s'appelle
Walkington et c'est plusieurs magasins et un bar. Ce n'est pas loin de Beverley qui est une ville belle. Année
dernier je suis allé à un musée intéressant avec mon collége. Nous allons aller à l'étranger en vacances. Notre
hôtel est près de la plage. S'il fait beau, je vais nage dans la mer tous les jours.
(92 words)
[12 marks]

AO2
All three bullet points are covered. Communication is mostly clear with occasional lapses in clarity:
parce que c'est ma propre chambre; c'est plusieurs magasins et un bar. Ideas are often developed especially in the
responses to bullets two and three. This places the work at level 4 (7 – 8 marks). Since a lot of
information, rather than quite a lot, is conveyed the work is closer to the level above than the level below,
so a mark of 8 is awarded.
AO3
A variety of appropriate vocabulary is used (propre, plusieurs, loin de, belle, tous les jours). There is
successful use of infinitive constructions, use of a relative clause introduced by qui, a weather
expression with faire and an ‘if’ clause in the final sentence. There is one past tense, various
present tenses and two attempts at a future reference, the first accurate, the second not. Errors are
mainly minor: slips in spelling and a lack of adjectival agreement, c'est is twice used instead of il y a. This
places the work at level 4 and it is awarded 4 marks.
This response is awarded 12 marks out of a possible 15 marks.


Q3 - Extended Writing 150 words

Section C
Question 03
For this question there are two compulsory bullet points, which are assessed for AO2 (15 marks), and
AO3 (10 marks), as specified in the criteria below. The maximum mark for Question 3 is 25.
The student is expected to produce approximately 150 words for this task. The number of words is
approximate and demonstration of the mark descriptors is more important than the word count. You must
mark all work produced by the student even if it is well beyond the suggested number of words.
Both bullet points must be covered, but there is no need for equal coverage of the bullets.
| Level | Mark AO2 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 13-15 | • A lot of information is conveyed in relation to the task. • Regular successful development of ideas, accounts and/or description. • Communication is clear with very few or no lapses in clarity. |
| 4 | 10-12 | • Quite a lot of information is conveyed in relation to the task. • Regular attempts at development of ideas, accounts and/or description which are mostly successful. • Communication is mostly clear but there are a few lapses in clarity. |
| 3 | 7-9 | • An adequate amount of information is conveyed in relation to the task. • Some successful development of ideas, accounts and/or description. • Communication is usually clear but there are some lapses in clarity. |
| 2 | 4-6 | • Some information is conveyed in relation to the task. • A little development of ideas, accounts and/or description. • Communication is sometimes unclear and there are regular lapses in clarity. |
| 1 | 1–3 | • A limited amount of information is conveyed in relation to the task. • Very limited or no development of ideas, accounts and/or description. • Communication is often unclear and there are frequent lapses in clarity. |
| 0 | 0 | The content does not meet the standard required for a mark at this tier.
Notes
- There may be some imbalance in the coverage of the two compulsory bullet points but, provided at least some coverage of all bullet points is evident, students will have access to full marks where the other criteria are met.
- When awarding a mark, all aspects of the descriptors must be considered and not only the number of bullet points covered.
- A student who conveys information in relation to only one bullet point can score a maximum of 12 marks for AO2.

Guidance for examiners
- The student's response must be relevant to the bullet points. Any information which cannot be deemed relevant must be ignored when awarding the mark for AO2. However, as the bullet points are much more open-ended, there is scope for students to include information which is still relevant but not in direct response to a bullet point. For example, when addressing a bullet point requiring a response about a past holiday, students may also refer to where they might go on a future holiday. Any information which cannot be deemed at all relevant must be ignored when awarding the mark for AO2.
- As with the overlap question, you must accept, as an accomplishment of the task, any plausible response to a bullet point, even if an element such as time or place is missing.
- In order to score a mark of 13 or more for AO2, both bullet points must be covered. However, there is no requirement for an equal coverage of both bullet points.
- Provided at least some coverage of both bullet points is evident, students will have access to full marks where the other criteria are met.
- The levels refer to the amount of information that is conveyed, as follows: 13 – 15: a lot 10 – 12: quite a lot 7 – 9: an adequate amount 4 – 6: some 1 – 3: a limited amount All of these have to be considered with reference to the recommended number of words which is approximately 150. In other words, a student who writes approximately 150 words, clearly understandable and conveying a lot of information relating to both bullet points, will be able to achieve 15 marks provided the other criteria are met. Conversely, a student may write much more than 150 words, but the language is so inaccurate that only a limited amount of information is conveyed successfully. If a student writes considerably fewer than 150 words, 'a lot of information' will not be conveyed.
- Once the correct level has been decided upon, the middle mark in the level will be given to a student whose writing fits the level well. If the level above was a consideration, then award the higher of the three marks; if the level below was a consideration, then award the lower of the three marks.
In this question, the marks for AO3 are split between Range and use of language (Grid 1) and Accuracy
(Grid 2). There is a maximum of five marks for each of these criteria, making a total of 10 marks for AO3
in this question.
The whole of the response must be assessed when awarding the marks for AO3, even if some of it is
irrelevant to the bullet points

Grid one: Range and use of language

| Level | Mark AO3 | Range and use of language |
|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| 5 | 5 | • Very good variety of appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures. • Complex language is regularly attempted and is often successful. |
| 4 | 4 | • Good variety of appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures. • Complex language is regularly attempted and is generally successful. |
| 3 | 3 | • Some variety of appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures. • Complex language is occasionally attempted and is sometimes successful. |
| 2 | 2 | • Little variety of appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures. • Short and simple structures are often used but there is also regular use of longer sentences, with linking words. |
| 1 | 1 | • Very little variety of appropriate vocabulary. • Structures used are mainly short and simple. |
| 0 | 0 | The language does not meet the standard required for Level 1 at this tier.
Grid two: Accuracy

| Level | Mark AO3 | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 5 | 5 | • The response is usually accurate, although there may be occasional major and some minor errors, especially in attempts at more complex structures. • Verbs and tense formations are secure. |
| 4 | 4 | • The response is generally accurate with several major and minor errors, usually in attempts at more complex structures. • Verbs and tense formations are generally correct. |
| 3 | 3 | • The response is reasonably accurate. There are major and minor errors in both simple and complex structures. • Verb and tense formations are sometimes correct. |
| 2 | 2 | • The response is more inaccurate than accurate. There are frequent major and minor errors. • Verb and tense formations are often incorrect. |
| 1 | 1 | • The response is mostly inaccurate. There are major and minor errors in all sentences. • Verb and tense formations are nearly always incorrect. |
| 0 | 0 | The accuracy of language produced does not meet the standard required for a mark at this tier.
Notes
• A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3. Apart from that, the AO2
mark does not limit the mark for AO3

 A major error is one which adversely affects communication.
• A minor error is one which does not affect communication.
Guidance for examiners
Once you have decided on the mark for AO2, you should read through the response once more and
decide on the marks for AO3. A mark of 0 for AO2 automatically results in marks of 0 for AO3 but, apart
from that, the AO2 mark does not limit the AO3 marks. However, a short piece is unlikely to show
sufficient variety for a high mark in AO3 for Range and use of language.
The following points should be taken into account when deciding on the mark to be awarded:
• For AO3 Range and use of language there are two strands: variety of vocabulary and structures and
complexity of sentences. For a mark of 5, there will be good evidence that the criteria for both strands
have been met comfortably. Sometimes it will be necessary to adopt a ‘best fit’ approach, because the
two strands will not be consistently demonstrated.
• There must be more complex sentences for the student to score 3 marks or more. See Glossary
below. This should not be seen as a ‘tick list’, but rather as an indication of the definition of complexity
at GCSE level.
• For the award of 5 marks for AO3 Accuracy, the writing need not be perfectly accurate. There may be
occasional errors in attempts at more complex language, but these will be infrequent.
• For a piece of writing that contains a good number of errors, a useful starting point will be to decide
whether overall it is more inaccurate than accurate. If it is, then the maximum mark will be 2.
• A major consideration in awarding marks for Accuracy is correctly formed verbs and tense formations.
All verbs and tense formations should be considered here but as there are only two bullet points in this
question, only two time frames will be elicited. While some students will develop their ideas and, in
doing so, use a third time frame and different tenses, there is not the same requirement as there is in
Foundation Question 5/Higher Question 2 to refer to all three time frames.
Glossary
The following glossary provides some guidance on terms used within the descriptors.
Lapse in clarity Use of language that causes a delay in communication. For example:
Mon écol est grande.
J'aime le football. C'est ennuyeux.
Le soir je prends mon petit déjeuner à douze heures.
Major error An error which adversely affects communication.
Some examples are:
Incorrect verb forms.
Incorrect use of pronouns.
Examples of major errors:
Tu aimes le sport for J'aime le sport.
Hier je mange un sandwich.
Minor error An error which does not affect communication.

Some examples are:
Incorrect but close to correct spellings.
Incorrect genders and errors of agreement.
Incorrect or missing accents unless these alter the meaning.
Examples of minor errors:
Mon collège est petite.
Mes proffesseurs sont intéressant.
Development A development is an additional detail, reasoning, justification and/or
elaboration of ideas, accounts and/or description. It can either be a clause
(‘Ma maison est grande et c'est super’)
or a phrase (‘J'habite à Manchester, dans le nord-ouest de l'Angleterre’)
Both of these examples are successful because they communicate clearly.
Unsuccessful attempts at developments are those which include lapses in
clarity. Examples are:
A l'avenir je vais chercher un bon travail. C'était une bonne idée parce que
je gagnais beaucoup.
Récemment je suis allé à un concert. C'était horrible parce que la chanteuse avait
une belle voix.
Variety of language Some examples:
Different ways of expressing opinions – j'aime/j'adore/je préfère,
c'est super/génial/excellent
Use of intensifiers
Different persons of the verb.
Complexity of
language and
structure
Some examples are:
use of infinitive constructions introduced by prepositions (pour, sans, avant de,
après, après avoir), adjectives (c'est difficile, il est possible), after nouns (j'ai
l'intention de), after verbs (je préfère aller, j'aime étudier, il faut
travailler, ça vaut la peine de visiter, arrêter de faire) and the modal verbs
devoir, pouvoir, vouloir, savoir, devoir.
use of object pronouns (me, te, nous, vous, le, la, les, lui, leur)
use of emphatic pronouns (eg pour moi, sans toi, avec moi etc)
use of impersonal verbs such as adorer, intéresser, sembler
use of indefinite pronouns/adjectives such as quelque chose, chaque

does not limit the mark for AO3.

The following indicative content is an example of the response that students may give to this question. It
demonstrates a balanced coverage of the compulsory bullet points. It would be awarded full marks.
Je crois que c'est très amusant de passer du temps avec des amis. Nous devons étudier énormément au collège
et c'est très important de trouver du temps pour se détendre. J'ai de la chance parce que j'ai plusieurs bons
amis et nous aimons faire du sport et aller au cinéma ou juste rester à la maison et bavarder un peu. Les
amis te comprennent parce qu'ils ont les mêmes expériences et ils peuvent t'aider si tu as un
problème. Un bon ami t'écoute, te donne des conseils et te soutient, sans dire tes secrets à personne.
Une de mes amies était très triste récemment parce que des filles de sa classe écrivaient des choses
méchantes sur elle sur Snapchat. J'ai essayé de l'aider, en disant qu'elles étaient bêtes, mais elles continuaient à la critiquer et
finalement nous avons décidé d'aller ensemble parler à notre prof. C'était une bonne décision parce que la prof
a organisé une réunion entre toutes et les filles ont dû demander pardon. J'espère que ça ne va pas se passer
encore une fois.

The following indicative content is an example of a response displaying some imbalance in the coverage
of the compulsory bullet points, although both bullet points are covered.
Pour moi, je préfère passe temps avec ma mère et pas beaucoup avec amis. Je ne vais dire que je n'ai pas
amis, et je sors fin de semaine acheter qui est plus amusant. Ma meilleure amie appelle Sara et venir à ma
maison de temps à temps.

Ce n'est pas pour tous. J'ai un ami vivre près de ma maison et nous allons ensemble au collège. Il trouve le difficile
parler avec ses parents parce qu'il parle que toujours sont très occupé avec les travaux et n'ont pas
intéressé. Récemment il était malade et ne pouvoir aller à classe pour un mois. Après de retourne au
collège, il avait quelques problèmes avec plusieurs matières et j'ai commencé à aider lui. Il a venu à ma maison pour
faire les devoirs tous les soirs. Si il n'a pas compris quelque chose, il pouvait demander moi. Maintenant tout est bien mais
nous continuons étudié ensemble parce que c'est plus amusant. Je dirais que notre amitié est plus fort maintenant.

AO2
Quite a lot of information is conveyed and communication is usually clear but with some lapses in clarity.
These include: acheter qui est plus amusant; venir à ma maison; Ce n'est pas pour tous; J'ai un ami vivre
près de ma maison; ne pouvoir aller à classe pour un mois. There is some successful development of ideas,
accounts and descriptions. This best matches the descriptors for Level 3. Given the amount of
information conveyed, one could consider a mark in Level 4. However, one cannot say that the regular
attempts at development are mostly successful, so a mark of 9 is awarded.
AO3 Range and use of language
Variety of language includes the use of the connectives, et, mais and parce que, different persons of the
verb and intensifiers. However, there are some inappropriate words: de temps à temps and intéressé
for intérêt. There is some variety of grammatical structures, but it is sometimes marred by error.
Complex language used includes use of adverbs and pronouns, pour + infinitive and present, imperfect
and perfect tenses. However, the attempts at complex language are only sometimes successful -
errors include: je ne vais dire; the regular incorrect positioning of pronouns; Après de retourne; nous continuons
étudié. The work best matches the Level 3 descriptors. There is some variety of appropriate
vocabulary and grammatical structures and complex language is sometimes successful. Therefore, a
mark of 3 at Level 3 is awarded.
AO3 Accuracy
The response is more inaccurate than accurate. There are frequent major errors such as the
inappropriate use of infinitives and verbs in the wrong person and there are frequent minor errors such
as a regular lack of agreement of adjectives, je préfère passe, plus for beaucoup, sont très occupé, tout est
bien. This matches the descriptors for award of marks at Level 2. Verb and tense formations are often
incorrect: Je ne vais dire, était, j'ai commencé, Il a venu, n'a pas compris, Je dirais. Again, the work matches the criteria for the
award of 2 marks at Level 2.
This response is awarded 14 marks out of a possible 25 marks.
Question 03.2
Below is some guidance on the specific bullet points included in the question:
| Bullet | Comments |
|--------|----------|
| The positive aspects of using technology. | Accept one statement about the positive aspects of using technology. Accept references to negative aspects as developments, although the positive aspects must be covered in order to fulfil the task. |
| What career plans you have for the future. | Accept one statement about what career plans the student has for the future. Accept references to other future plans as developments although career plans must be covered in order to fulfil the task. | 

demonstrates a balanced coverage of the compulsory bullet points. It would be awarded full marks.
Je crois que la technologie apporte beaucoup d'avantages et je passe beaucoup de temps à l'utiliser. Mon portable est très utilisé -
il me réveille le matin, je l'utilise pour bavarder avec mes amis et pour prendre des photos et je regarde toujours
mes messages avant de me coucher. C'est très facile de faire des achats sur Internet et j'ai l'habitude d'acheter tous
mes cadeaux là-bas. Nous utilisons beaucoup la technologie au collège et j'ai un ordinateur portable qui m'aide avec mes
études et c'est amusant de jouer aux jeux vidéo.
Je ne sais pas encore exactement ce que je vais faire à l'avenir pour gagner de l'argent. Mon prof dit que
je devrais considérer une carrière dans l'éducation, ou peut-être comme avocat, mais ils me semblent des
emplois assez ennuyeux. Au collège, je suis bon en sciences et en maths et c'est pourquoi j'ai pensé
à être ingénieur, peut-être dans l'armée, parce qu'il y aura des opportunités pour voyager et ils me
paieront assez bien. C'est une décision très difficile.

The following indicative content is an example of a response displaying some imbalance in the coverage
of the compulsory bullet points, although both bullet points are covered.
Les appareils être très chers et c'est pourquoi seulement j'ai un portable vieux. J'aime utiliser la technologie au
collège parce que les cours sont plus intéressants et ma famille regarde Netflix sur la télé s'il y a une bonne
film.
L'année dernière nous avons cour pour nous aider à choisir une carrière. Représentants de plusieurs
professions sont veni au collège et ont parlé de ce qu'ils ont l'habitude font dans leur travail. Le policier a été très
intéressant et a recommenié la police comme carrière, mais ma mère ne lui plaît pas l'idée parce qu'elle dit que
c'est trop dangereux. Mon père travaille pour le gouvernement et ne lui plaît pas du tout, croire que c'est un
travail ennuyeux qui ne paie pas bien. Encore je ne suis pas sûre de quoi je vais faire, mais je crois que je serai
une professeure dans une école. J'aurais que aller à l'université et étudo beaucoup mais me semble un
travail intéressant.

AO2
Communication is mostly clear but there are a few lapses in clarity for example Les appareils être très
chers; L'année dernière nous avons cour; croire que c'est un travail ennuyeux. There are regular attempts at
development of ideas, accounts and description which are mostly successful. This places the work at
Level 4. Given that there is still a lot rather than quite a lot of information conveyed, one would consider
Level 5, so a mark of 12 is awarded.
AO3 Range and use of language
There is a good variety of appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures, including different ways of
expressing opinions, intensifiers and different persons of the verb. Complex language is regularly
attempted and includes comparatives, subordinate clauses, a range of infinitive constructions and
present, preterite, future and conditional tenses. However, these are not always successful for example
in language such as: pour nous aider; ont l'habitude font; ma mère ne lui plaît pas l'idée; J'aurais que aller à la
université et étudo beaucoup. For this reason, complex language is generally rather than mostly
successful and a mark of 4 at Level 4 is awarded.

AO3 Accuracy
The response is generally accurate. There are several major errors errors, notably the two inappropriate
infinitives, and several minor errors, usually in more complex structures: pour nous aider; ont l'habitude font;
ma mère ne lui plaît pas l'idée; J'aurais que aller à la université et étudo beaucoup. Verb and tense
formations are generally correct, with only minor slips in sont veni and a recommenié and one example of
the use of the wrong tense: L'année dernière nous avons cour. While a mark of 3 was a consideration, it
would be too harsh to say that overall the response is only reasonably accurate and that verb and tense
formations are only sometimes correct. As such a mark of 4 at Level 4 is awarded.
This response is awarded 20 marks out of a possible 25 marks.
