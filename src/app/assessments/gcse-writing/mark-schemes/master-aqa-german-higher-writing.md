Q1 - Translation (English → German) 10 marks

Section A
Question 01
The translation is assessed for AO3 (10 marks) as specified in the criteria below. The maximum mark for
Question 1 is 10. When awarding the marks for Grid One and Grid Two, the student’s response across
all five sentences should be considered as a whole.
When awarding the mark for Grid One out of a maximum of five, the translation is divided into 15
elements as shown in the grid on page 7. A tick will be awarded for each element that is communicated,
despite any minor inaccuracies. The number of ticks out of 15 in column 2 of Grid One below equates to
a mark out of five in column 3.
Grid One: Rendering of the original meaning

| Level | Number of ticks credited | Marks AO3 | Description |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 5 | 13-15 | 5 | The meanings of all or nearly all elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 4 | 10-12 | 4 | The meanings of most elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 3 | 7-9 | 3 | The meanings of some elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 2 | 4-6 | 2 | The meanings of few elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 1 | 1-3 | 1 | The meanings of very few elements of the original language are sufficiently rendered. |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | No elements of the meanings of the original language are conveyed.
Once the mark for Grid One is awarded, a mark out of five is awarded for Grid Two. This mark is based
on the student’s response across all five sentences as a whole.
Grid Two: Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar

| Level | Marks AO3 | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 5 | 5 | • Very good knowledge of the required vocabulary. Few if any inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is highly accurate and any errors that occur are only minor. |
| 4 | 4 | • Good knowledge of vocabulary. Some inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is generally accurate with regular minor errors. |
| 3 | 3 | • Satisfactory knowledge of vocabulary. Regular inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is more accurate than inaccurate. Regular major and minor errors. |
| 2 | 2 | • Limited knowledge of vocabulary. Many inappropriate or omitted items. • Grammar is generally inaccurate. Many major and minor errors. |
| 1 | 1 | • Very limited knowledge of vocabulary. Few appropriate items. • Grammar is highly inaccurate. Major and minor errors in all or almost all sentences. |
| 0 | 0 | The language produced does not meet the standard required for Level 1 at this tier.
Notes
- A mark of zero in Grid One automatically results in a mark of zero in Grid Two, but apart from that, the Rendering of original meaning mark does not limit the mark for Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar.
- A major error is one which adversely affects communication.
- A minor error is one which does not affect communication.
Guidance for Examiners
When deciding on whether an element is conveyed, you should ask yourself the question: ‘Would a
native speaker understand the target language version without reference to the original English?’ If the
answer is ‘yes’, award a tick.
A major error is an error which adversely affects communication. Some examples are:
Incorrect verb forms.
Incorrect use of pronouns.
Examples of major errors:
Du magst Sport for Ich mag Sport.
Gestern esse ich ein Sandwich.
A minor error is an error which does not affect communication. Some examples are:
Incorrect but close to correct spellings.
Incorrect genders and errors of agreement.
Incorrect or missing accents unless these alter the meaning.
Examples of minor errors:
Mein Schule ist klein.
Meine Lehrers sind interessant

| Element of original language | Indicative content | Alternative acceptable renderings | Reject |
|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------|
| 1 | I went to school | Ich bin zur Schule gegangen | Ich ging zur Schule | Ich bin zur Schule gegangen |
| 2 | on the bus | mit dem Bus | im Bus |  |
| 3 | this morning. | heute Morgen. |  | Morgen [alone] |
| 4 | I am going to spend | Ich werde verbringen | Ich verbringe |  |
| 5 | three days at | drei Tage bei |  |  |
| 6 | my aunt's house. | dem Haus meiner Tante. | bei meiner Tante | meiner Tante's Haus |
| 7 | My sister eats | Meine Schwester isst |  |  |
| 8 | too much fast food, | zu viel Fastfood / Fast Food | zu viel schnelles Essen |  |
| 9 | but I try | aber ich versuche | ich probiere |  |
| 10 | to avoid it. | es zu vermeiden. |  | Pronoun es placed before versuche |
| 11 | I used to play basketball | Ich habe früher Basketball gespielt | ich spielte Basketball |  |
| 12 | every week | jede Woche | alle Wochen |  |
| 13 | when I was younger. | als ich jünger war. | als ich kleiner war. |  |
| 14 | We have just seen | Wir haben gerade gesehen |  |  |
| 15 | our new teacher. | unseren neuen Lehrer. | unsere neue Lehrerin. |  |
Other reasonable alternative renderings of the original meaning will also be accepted. However, verbs in
the wrong tense and/or person will not be credited/accepted.
Once you have decided on the mark for Grid One, you should read through the translation once more
and decide on the mark out of 5 for Grid Two.
This mark is not limited by the mark for Grid One, unless the mark is zero, in which case the mark for
Grid Two must also be zero.
If a student leaves gaps, you must assume that any attempt would have been highly inaccurate and take
this into account when awarding marks in Grid Two. Not to do so will penalise unfairly those students
who make an attempt but commit serious errors in so doing.
Perfection is not required for full marks. For example, occasional missing accents and minor spelling
errors do not preclude a top band mark. However, if there are numerous minor errors and incorrect use
of accents which change the meaning of a word, this is likely to have an impact on the mark for Grid
Two, knowledge of vocabulary and grammar.


Q2 - Extended Writing 90 words

Question 05 - extended writing - Maximum 15 marks

Question 05
For this question, there are three compulsory bullet points which are assessed for AO2 (10 marks) and
AO3 (5 marks), as specified in the criteria below. The maximum mark for Question 5 is 15.
The student is expected to produce approximately 90 words for this task. The number of words is
approximate and demonstration of the mark descriptors is more important than the word count. You must
mark all work produced by the student, even if it is well beyond the suggested number of words.
All bullet points must be covered, but there is no need for equal coverage of the bullet points.
| Level | Mark AO2 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 9-10 | • All three bullet points are covered. • Communication is clear. • Ideas are regularly developed with a lot of relevant information being conveyed. |
| 4 | 7-8 | • All three bullet points are covered. • Communication is mostly clear but perhaps with occasional lapses in clarity. • Ideas are often developed with quite a lot of relevant information being conveyed. |
| 3 | 5-6 | • At least two bullet points are covered. • Communication is generally clear but there are likely to be lapses in clarity. • A few ideas may be developed and some relevant information is conveyed. |
| 2 | 3-4 | • At least one bullet point is covered. • Communication is sometimes clear and there are regular lapses in clarity. • Little relevant information is conveyed. |
| 1 | 1-2 | • At least one bullet point is covered. • Communication is often not clear and there are very many lapses in clarity. • Very little relevant information is conveyed. |
| 0 | 0 | The content does not meet the standard required for a mark at this tier.

Notes
- There may be some imbalance in the coverage of the three compulsory bullet points but, provided at least some coverage of all bullet points is evident, students will have access to full marks where the other criteria are met.
- When awarding a mark, all aspects of the descriptors must be considered and not only the number of bullet points covered.

Guidance for examiners
- The information that the student gives must be clear. If what is written is unclear, this will have a bearing on the mark for AO2. For example, the student may convey information in relation to all three bullet points, but lapses in clarity may mean that a lower mark than the 9 or 10 is more appropriate. The more lapses in clarity that there are, the lower the mark is likely to be. All of the information that a student attempts to give in relation to a particular bullet point may be unintelligible, in which case that bullet point will not have been covered, meaning that the maximum mark will be 6.
- You must accept any information which is a plausible response to the bullet point, even if it does not explicitly mention, for instance, a time or place. For example, if the bullet asks what the student did last weekend, and he/she writes 'I went to see my aunt and then went to the cinema', this can feasibly be an account of what happened last weekend, even though 'last weekend' is not mentioned. Equally, if the student is asked to say what he/she does on a typical visit to a shopping centre and they write 'I buy some clothes and go to see a film', this is also an acceptable fulfilment of the task, even though 'shopping centre' is not mentioned.
- The levels refer to the amount of information that is conveyed, as follows: 9 – 10: a lot 7 – 8: quite a lot 5 – 6: some 3 – 4: little 1 – 2: very little All of these have to be considered with reference to the suggested number of words, which is approximately 90. In other words, a student who writes approximately 90 words, clearly understandable and relevant to all three bullet points, will be able to achieve 10 marks, provided the other criteria are met. Conversely, a student may write much more than 90 words, but the language is so inaccurate that little or very little information is conveyed successfully and the mark will be much lower. If a student writes considerably fewer than 90 words, 'a lot of information' will not be conveyed.
- When deciding a particular mark, it is advisable to identify the level of marks first, and then consider how close the response is to the level above or to the level below. This will enable you to award an appropriate mark within the level. For example, if the response is closer to the descriptors in the level above, you would award the higher of the two marks in the level.

| Level | Mark AO3 | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 5 | 5 | • A good variety of vocabulary is used. • There are regular attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to all three time frames which are mainly successful. • Any errors are mainly minor but some major errors may occur, particularly in complex structures and sentences. |
| 4 | 4 | • A variety of vocabulary is used. • There are some attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to at least two different time frames which are mainly successful. • Errors are mainly minor but some major errors may occur. |
| 3 | 3 | • Some variety of vocabulary is used. • There may be occasional attempts at complexity of language and structure. • There are references to at least two different time frames, although these may not always be successful. • There may be some major errors, and minor errors occur regularly but overall the response is more accurate than inaccurate. |
| 2 | 2 | • A limited variety of vocabulary is used. • The language is mainly simple but there may be some attempts at longer sentences with appropriate linking words. • There may be no successful references to different time frames. • There may be frequent major and minor errors and overall the response is generally inaccurate. |
| 1 | 1 | • The range of vocabulary is narrow and/or repetitive. • The language is simple and sentences are short or may not be properly constructed. • There are no successful references to different time frames. • There may be frequent major and minor errors and overall the response is highly inaccurate. |
| 0 | 0 | The language does not meet the standard required for Level 1 at this tier.

Notes
• A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3. Apart from that, the AO2
mark does not limit the mark for AO3.
• A major error is one which adversely affects communication.
• A minor error is one which does not affect communication

Guidance for examiners
A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3. Apart from that, the AO2 mark
does not limit the mark for AO3. For example:
• If a student has only addressed 2 bullet points clearly but has produced a response that includes a
good variety of vocabulary, regular attempts at complexity of language and structure, successful
references to all three time frames with errors that are mainly minor and some major errors in
complex structures and sentences, then a mark of 6+5 is possible.
• If a student has clearly addressed all 3 bullet points but has produced a response with some variety
of appropriate vocabulary, occasional attempts at complexity of language and structure, references
to at least two different time frames, with some major errors and minor errors occurring regularly,
then a mark of 10+3 is possible.
Once you have decided on the mark for AO2, you should read through the response once more and
decide on the mark for AO3. A mark of 0 for AO2 automatically results in a mark of 0 for AO3 but, apart
from that, the mark for AO2 does not limit the mark for AO3. However, a short piece is unlikely to
demonstrate sufficient variety for a high mark for AO3.
The whole of the response must be assessed when awarding the mark for AO3, even if some of it is
irrelevant to the bullet points.
The following points should be taken into account when deciding on the mark to be awarded:
• Each level has four strands: variety of vocabulary; complexity of structures and sentences; reference
to time frames; accuracy of the language. Sometimes it will be necessary to adopt a ‘best fit’
approach, because the four strands will not be consistently demonstrated.
• In order to score 5 marks, there must be reference to all three time frames (past, present and future).
For 4 marks, there must be reference to at least two time frames. Reference to a particular time frame
may be demonstrated with one example. The verb used to refer to a particular time frame need not be
totally correct, provided the message is clear. These marks are not awarded automatically and the
other criteria in the level are equally important. Notice that references are to time frames, not tenses.
So, for example, the present tense usage in the following sentence is a reference to a future time
frame: ‘I’m going to the concert next week’.
• When considering the complexity of the language, you should bear in mind that a) this is the overlap
question and is attempted by both Foundation and Higher students; b) that the criteria for AO3 in this
question are not as demanding as the language criteria for Higher Question 3. However, for a mark of
3, 4 or 5, complex structures and sentences are attempted. They may not always be successful and
this may lead to serious errors because of the complexity of the structure or sentence which the
student attempts. Complexity may be shown in some of the following ways: different tenses; time
markers; connectives; subordinate clauses; infinitive constructions. This should not be seen as a ‘tick
list’, but rather as an indication of the definition of complexity at GCSE level.
• There is no requirement for students to present their piece of writing in a particular way because of the
context, eg a blog or email does not need to look like a blog or email. It is the content which is to be
marked

Glossary
The following glossary provides some guidance on terms used within the descriptors.
Lapse in clarity Use of language that causes a delay in communication. For example:
Mein Schule ist groß.
Ich mag Fußball. Es ist langweilig.
Abends esse ich mein Frühstück um zwölf Uhr.
Major error An error which adversely affects communication.
Some examples are:
Incorrect verb forms.
Incorrect use of pronouns.
Examples of major errors:
Du magst Sport for Ich mag Sport.
Gestern esse ich ein Sandwich.
Minor error An error which does not affect communication.

Some examples are:
Incorrect but close to correct spellings.
Incorrect genders and errors of agreement.
Incorrect or missing accents unless these alter the meaning.
Examples of minor errors:
Mein Schule ist klein.
Meine Lehrers sind interessant.
Development A development is an additional detail, reasoning, justification and/or
elaboration of ideas, accounts and/or description. It can either be a clause
(‘Mein Haus ist groß und es ist super’)
or a phrase (‘Ich wohne in Manchester, im Nordwesten von England’)
Both of these examples are successful because they communicate clearly.
Unsuccessful attempts at developments are those which include lapses in
clarity. Examples are:
In der Zukunft ich werde suchen eine gute Arbeit. Das war eine gute Idee weil
ich verdiente viel Geld.
Neulich ich bin gegangen zu einem Konzert. Es war schrecklich weil die Sängerin hatte
eine schöne Stimme.
Variety of language Some examples:
Different ways of expressing opinions – ich mag/ich liebe/ich bevorzuge,
es ist toll/genial/ausgezeichnet
Use of intensifiers
Different persons of the verb.
Complexity of
language and
structure
Some examples are:
use of infinitive constructions introduced by prepositions (um...zu, ohne...zu, vor,
nach, nachdem), adjectives (es ist schwierig, es ist möglich), after nouns (ich habe
die Absicht zu), after verbs (ich bevorzuge zu gehen, ich mag lernen, man muss
arbeiten, es lohnt sich zu besuchen, aufhören zu machen) and the modal verbs
sollen, können, wollen, wissen, müssen.
use of object pronouns (mich, dich, uns, euch, ihn, sie, es, sie, Ihren)
use of emphatic pronouns (eg für mich, ohne dich, mit mir etc)
use of impersonal verbs such as gefallen, interessieren, scheinen
use of indefinite pronouns/adjectives such as etwas, jeder
use of connectives such as obwohl, wegen, außerdem
use of adverbs and adverbial phrases such as kaum, jedoch,
dann, zweifellos, zum Beispiel, schließlich, normalerweise
use of negatives (nicht … nichts/niemand/nie/kein/weder/auch nicht etc)
use of seit constructions and constructions such as gerade gemacht haben…
use of comparative adjectives and expressions such as mehr…als,
weniger…als, so…wie and besser/schlechter
use of demonstrative adjectives and pronouns (dieser, diese, dieses, was etc)
use of adjectives with neuter article 'das' used as nouns (das Gute etc)
use of possessive pronouns (meins, etc)
use of superlative adjective (der größte, die kleinste, der/die
beste, die besten, der/die schlechteste, die schlechtesten, etc)
use of a range of tenses (eg Perfekt, Imperfekt, Futur (werden +
Infinitive), Konjunktiv)
use of subordinate clauses introduced by eg weil, deshalb, wenn etc.
use of relative clauses introduced by das, der, die, wo, wann
use of coordinating conjunctions: also, oder, dann, aber, (when using
longer sentences).

Notes
A mark of zero for AO2 automatically results in a mark of zero for AO3. Apart from that, the AO2 mark
does not limit the mark for AO3.
Question 03.1
Below is some guidance on the specific bullet points included in the question:
| Bullet | Comments |
|--------|----------|
| The positive aspects of spending time with friends. | Accept one statement about the positive aspects of spending time with friends. Accept references to negative aspects as developments, although the positive aspects must be covered in order to fulfil the task. |
| Something you did recently to help a friend. | Accept one statement about something the student did recently to help a friend. |
The following indicative content is an example of the response that students may give to this question. It
demonstrates a balanced coverage of the compulsory bullet points. It would be awarded full marks.
Ich glaube, dass es sehr lustig ist, Zeit mit Freunden zu verbringen. Wir müssen in der Schule wahnsinnig viel lernen und es ist sehr wichtig, Zeit zum Entspannen zu finden. Ich habe Glück, weil ich mehrere gute Freunde habe und wir machen gerne Sport und gehen ins Kino oder bleiben einfach zu Hause und plaudern ein bisschen. Freunde verstehen dich, weil sie die gleichen Erfahrungen haben und sie können dir helfen, wenn du ein Problem hast. Ein guter Freund hört dir zu, gibt dir Ratschläge und unterstützt dich, ohne deine Geheimnisse jemandem zu erzählen. Eine meiner Freundinnen war neulich sehr traurig, weil einige Mädchen aus ihrer Klasse hässliche Dinge über sie auf Snapchat geschrieben haben. Ich habe versucht, ihr zu helfen, indem ich sagte, dass sie dumm sind, aber sie haben sie weiter kritisiert und schließlich haben wir beschlossen, zusammen zu unserer Lehrerin zu gehen, um mit ihr zu sprechen. Das war eine gute Entscheidung, weil die Lehrerin ein Treffen mit allen organisiert hat und die Mädchen mussten sich entschuldigen. Ich hoffe, dass das nicht noch einmal passiert.

The following indicative content is an example of a response displaying some imbalance in the coverage
of the compulsory bullet points, although both bullet points are covered.
Für mich, ich bevorzuge verbringe Zeit mit meiner Mutter und nicht viel mit Freunden. Ich gehe nicht sagen dass ich habe keine
Freunde, und ich gehe aus Wochenende kaufen was ist mehr lustig. Meine beste Freundin nennt Sara und kommen zu meinem
Haus von Zeit zu Zeit.

Es ist nicht für alle. Ich habe einen Freund wohnen nah mein Haus und wir gehen zusammen zur Schule. Er findet es schwierig
sprechen mit seinen Eltern weil er spricht dass immer sind sehr beschäftigt mit den Arbeiten und haben nicht
interessiert. Neulich war er krank und nicht können gehen zur Klasse für einen Monat. Nach von kommt zurück zur
Schule, er hatte einige Probleme mit mehreren Fächern und ich habe angefangen zu helfen ihn. Er ist gekommen zu meinem Haus um zu
machen die Hausaufgaben alle Abende. Wenn er nicht verstanden etwas, er konnte fragen mich. Jetzt alles ist gut aber
wir machen weiter gelernt zusammen weil es ist mehr lustig. Ich würde sagen dass unsere Freundschaft ist stärker jetzt.

[14 marks]
AO2
Quite a lot of information is conveyed and communication is usually clear but with some lapses in clarity.
These include: kaufen was ist mehr lustig; kommen zu meinem Haus; Es ist nicht für alle; Ich habe einen Freund wohnen 
nah mein Haus; nicht können gehen zur Klasse für einen Monat. There is some successful development of ideas,
accounts and descriptions. This best matches the descriptors for Level 3. Given the amount of
information conveyed, one could consider a mark in Level 4. However, one cannot say that the regular
attempts at development are mostly successful, so a mark of 9 is awarded.
AO3 Range and use of language
Variety of language includes the use of the connectives, und, aber and weil, different persons of the
verb and intensifiers. However, there are some inappropriate words: von Zeit zu Zeit and interessiert
for Interesse. There is some variety of grammatical structures, but it is sometimes marred by error.
Complex language used includes use of adverbs and pronouns, um...zu + infinitive and present, imperfect
and perfect tenses. However, the attempts at complex language are only sometimes successful -
errors include: ich gehe nicht sagen; the regular incorrect positioning of pronouns; Nach von kommt zurück; wir machen weiter
gelernt. The work best matches the Level 3 descriptors. There is some variety of appropriate
vocabulary and grammatical structures and complex language is sometimes successful. Therefore, a
mark of 3 at Level 3 is awarded.
AO3 Accuracy
The response is more inaccurate than accurate. There are frequent major errors such as the
inappropriate use of infinitives and verbs in the wrong person and there are frequent minor errors such
as a regular lack of agreement of adjectives, ich bevorzuge verbringe, mehr for sehr, sind sehr beschäftigt, alles ist
gut. This matches the descriptors for award of marks at Level 2. Verb and tense formations are often
incorrect: Ich gehe nicht sagen, war, ich habe angefangen, Er ist gekommen, nicht verstanden, Ich würde sagen. Again, the work matches the criteria for the
award of 2 marks at Level 2.
This response is awarded 14 marks out of a possible 25 marks.
Question 03.2
Below is some guidance on the specific bullet points included in the question:
| Bullet | Comments |
|--------|----------|
| The positive aspects of using technology. | Accept one statement about the positive aspects of using technology. Accept references to negative aspects as developments, although the positive aspects must be covered in order to fulfil the task. |
| What career plans you have for the future. | Accept one statement about what career plans the student has for the future. Accept references to other future plans as developments although career plans must be covered in order to fulfil the task. | 

demonstrates a balanced coverage of the compulsory bullet points. It would be awarded full marks.
Ich glaube, dass die Technologie viele Vorteile bringt und ich verbringe viel Zeit damit, sie zu nutzen. Mein Handy ist sehr nützlich -
es weckt mich am Morgen, ich benutze es, um mit meinen Freunden zu plaudern und Fotos zu machen und ich schaue immer
auf meine Nachrichten, bevor ich ins Bett gehe. Es ist sehr einfach, im Internet einzukaufen, und ich kaufe gewöhnlich alle
meine Geschenke dort. Wir benutzen die Technologie viel in der Schule und ich habe einen Laptop, der mir bei meinen
Studien hilft und es macht Spaß, Videospiele zu spielen.
Ich weiß noch nicht genau, was ich in der Zukunft machen werde, um Geld zu verdienen. Mein Lehrer sagt, dass
ich eine Karriere in der Bildung in Betracht ziehen sollte, oder möglicherweise als Anwalt, aber sie scheinen mir
ziemlich langweilige Berufe zu sein. In der Schule bin ich gut in Naturwissenschaften und Mathe und deshalb habe ich daran gedacht,
Ingenieur zu werden, vielleicht in der Armee, weil es Möglichkeiten geben wird zu reisen und sie werden mir
ziemlich gut bezahlen. Es ist eine sehr schwierige Entscheidung.

[25 marks]
The following indicative content is an example of a response displaying some imbalance in the coverage
of the compulsory bullet points, although both bullet points are covered.
Die Geräte sein sehr teuer und deshalb nur ich habe ein Handy alt. Ich mag benutzen die Technologie in der
Schule weil die Klassen sind mehr interessant und meine Familie schaut Netflix auf dem Fernseher wenn es gibt einen guten
Film.
Letztes Jahr wir haben Klassen für uns helfen eine Karriere zu wählen. Vertreter von mehreren
Berufen sind gekommt zur Schule und haben gesprochen von was sie gewöhnlich machen in ihrer Arbeit. Der Polizist war sehr
interessant und empfohlte die Polizei als Karriere, aber meine Mutter nicht gefällt ihr die Idee weil sie sagt dass
es ist zu gefährlich. Mein Vater arbeitet für die Regierung und nicht gefällt ihm gar nicht, glauben dass es ist eine
Arbeit langweilig die nicht bezahlt gut. Noch ich bin nicht sicher was ich werde machen, aber ich glaube dass ich werde sein
eine Lehrerin in einer Schule. Ich würde haben dass gehen zur Universität und studiero viel aber mir scheint eine
Arbeit interessant.
(155 words)
[20 marks]
AO2
Communication is mostly clear but there are a few lapses in clarity for example Die Geräte sein sehr
teuer; Letztes Jahr wir haben Klassen; glauben dass es ist eine Arbeit langweilig. There are regular attempts at
development of ideas, accounts and description which are mostly successful. This places the work at
Level 4. Given that there is still a lot rather than quite a lot of information conveyed, one would consider
Level 5, so a mark of 12 is awarded.
AO3 Range and use of language
There is a good variety of appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures, including different ways of
expressing opinions, intensifiers and different persons of the verb. Complex language is regularly
attempted and includes comparatives, subordinate clauses, a range of infinitive constructions and
present, preterite, future and conditional tenses. However, these are not always successful for example
in language such as: für uns helfen; was sie gewöhnlich machen; meine Mutter nicht gefällt ihr die Idee; Ich würde haben dass gehen zur
Universität und studiero viel. For this reason, complex language is generally rather than mostly
successful and a mark of 4 at Level 4 is awarded.

AO3 Accuracy
The response is generally accurate. There are several major errors errors, notably the two inappropriate
infinitives, and several minor errors, usually in more complex structures: für uns helfen; was sie gewöhnlich machen;
meine Mutter nicht gefällt ihr die Idee; Ich würde haben dass gehen zur Universität und studiero viel. Verb and tense
formations are generally correct, with only minor slips in sind gekommt and empfohlte and one example of
the use of the wrong tense: Letztes Jahr wir haben Klassen. While a mark of 3 was a consideration, it
would be too harsh to say that overall the response is only reasonably accurate and that verb and tense
formations are only sometimes correct. As such a mark of 4 at Level 4 is awarded.
This response is awarded 20 marks out of a possible 25 marks.
