## Implementation Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Tables Created
1. **edexcel_listening_assessments**

   - 50 marks total (40 Section A + 10 Section B)

2. **edexcel_listening_questions**
   - Question data with section classification (A/B)
   - Question types: multiple-choice, multiple-response, word-cloud, open-response-a, open-response-c, dictation

3. **edexcel_listening_results**
   - Student results with section-specific scoring
   - Performance tracking by question type, theme, topic

### Services

### Components

#### EdexcelListeningAssessment
Main assessment component with:
- Timer management (45/60 minutes)
- Audio controls with play count tracking
- Section-aware progress tracking
- Question navigation
- Results display with section breakdown

#### Question Type Components
1. **EdexcelMultipleChoiceQuestion** - Single answer selection
2. **EdexcelMultipleResponseQuestion** - Multiple answer selection
3. **EdexcelWordCloudQuestion** - Gap-fill from word bank
4. **EdexcelOpenResponseAQuestion** - Structured open response
5. **EdexcelOpenResponseCQuestion** - Traditional open response
6. **EdexcelDictationQuestion** - Section B dictation with gaps

### Routing Structure

```
/edexcel-listening-test/[language]/[tier]/[paper]
```

Examples:
- `/edexcel-listening-test/es/foundation/paper-1`
- `/edexcel-listening-test/fr/higher/paper-1`
- `/edexcel-listening-test/de/foundation/paper-2`

## Question Types Implementation

### Multiple Choice
- Single correct answer per question
- Options labeled A, B, C
- Used in Foundation Q1, Q5, Q7, Q10 and Higher Q1, Q4, Q8

### Multiple Response
- Multiple correct answers possible
- Checkbox-style selection
- Used in Foundation Q2, Q4, Q9 and Higher Q3, Q9(a)

### Word Cloud
- Gap-fill exercise with word bank
- More words than gaps provided
- Used in Foundation Q3, Q8 and Higher Q2, Q6

### Open Response (Example A)
- Structured format with speaker names and labeled gaps
- Answers in English, complete sentences not required
- Used in Foundation Q6, Q11(b) and Higher Q5, Q7

### Open Response (Example C)
- Traditional open response format
- Questions like "Name one thing mentioned about..."
- Used in Foundation Q11(a) and Higher Q9(b)

### Dictation (Section B)
- 6 sentences with gaps to fill
- Different gap types based on tier:
  - **Foundation**: 
    - Sentences 1: Two gaps from vocabulary list
    - Sentences 2-3: One gap from vocabulary list, one outside
    - Sentences 4-6: Open sentences, all from vocabulary list
  - **Higher**:
    - Sentence 1: Three gaps (two from vocab, one outside)
    - Sentence 2: Three gaps (one from vocab, two outside)
    - Sentences 3-6: Open sentences from vocabulary list

## Integration with Exam Style Assessment

### Updated Assessment Page
- Added Edexcel option to exam board selection
- Edexcel listening assessments display when selected
- Proper filtering by language and difficulty
- Placeholder sections for other Edexcel skills (reading, writing, speaking)

### Task Routing

- Redirects to appropriate Edexcel listening test URLs

## Audio Implementation

### Audio Features
- 3x playback per question (Edexcel requirement)
- Play count tracking for analytics
- Mute/unmute controls
- Audio URL support for pre-recorded content
- TTS configuration for dynamic audio generation

### TTS Configuration
```json
{
  "voiceName": "es-ES-Standard-A",
  "multiSpeaker": true,

    {"name": "Carlos", "voiceName": "es-ES-Standard-B"}
  ],
  "style": "conversational"
}
```

## Scoring and Analytics

const responses = [/* question responses */];
const success = await service.submitAssessment(
  resultId, 
  responses, 
  totalTimeSeconds, 
  audioPlayCounts
);
```
