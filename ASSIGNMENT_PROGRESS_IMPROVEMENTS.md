# Assignment Progress Tracking Improvements

## Current Problems

### 1. Binary Completion Only
- ❌ Games show as 0% until fully completed
- ❌ No visibility into partial progress
- ❌ Students can't see their work-in-progress

### 2. Data Disconnect
- ✅ Data IS being tracked (sessions, vocabulary, gems)
- ❌ Data is NOT being displayed on assignment page
- ❌ Progress calculation ignores in-progress activities

### 3. Missing Engagement Metrics
- No session count display
- No words practiced count
- No time spent indicator
- No "last played" timestamp

## Proposed Solutions

### **Solution 1: Enhanced Progress Calculation**

Instead of binary completed/not-completed, calculate progress based on:

```typescript
interface GameProgress {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  completed: boolean;
  
  // NEW: Partial progress indicators
  progressPercentage: number;  // 0-100 based on activity
  sessionsStarted: number;      // How many times played
  wordsAttempted: number;       // Words seen
  wordsCorrect: number;         // Words answered correctly
  gemsEarned: number;           // Total gems from this game
  lastPlayedAt: Date | null;   // Most recent session
  timeSpent: number;            // Total seconds spent
  
  // Status indicators
  status: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
}
```

### **Solution 2: Visual Progress Indicators**

#### A. Overall Assignment Progress
```
Current: "0% Progress" (10 games, 0 completed)
Improved: "35% Progress" (10 games: 5 in progress, 3 not started, 2 completed)
```

Calculate as:
- Not started: 0% weight
- In progress: 50% weight (or based on actual activity)
- Completed: 100% weight

#### B. Per-Game Progress Cards

**Current Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Noughts & Crosses       │
│ Strategic gameplay...   │
│ ❌ Not completed        │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Improved Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Noughts & Crosses                   │
│ Strategic gameplay...               │
│                                     │
│ 🎮 2 sessions • 15 words practiced  │
│ 💎 3 gems earned • ⏱️ 8 min         │
│                                     │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░ 45% complete      │
│                                     │
│ 🟡 In Progress                      │
│ Last played: 2 hours ago            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Solution 3: Smart Progress Calculation**

For each game, calculate progress based on:

```typescript
function calculateGameProgress(gameId: string, assignmentId: string, studentId: string) {
  // Get all sessions for this game
  const sessions = await getGameSessions(gameId, assignmentId, studentId);
  
  // Get vocabulary progress
  const vocabStats = await getVocabularyStats(assignmentId, studentId);
  
  // Calculate progress percentage
  let progressPercentage = 0;
  
  if (sessions.length === 0) {
    progressPercentage = 0; // Not started
  } else {
    // Base progress on activity
    const hasStarted = sessions.length > 0 ? 20 : 0;
    const wordProgress = Math.min((vocabStats.wordsAttempted / vocabStats.totalWords) * 60, 60);
    const accuracyBonus = (vocabStats.accuracy / 100) * 20;
    
    progressPercentage = hasStarted + wordProgress + accuracyBonus;
  }
  
  return {
    progressPercentage: Math.min(progressPercentage, 100),
    status: progressPercentage === 0 ? 'not_started' 
          : progressPercentage === 100 ? 'completed' 
          : 'in_progress',
    sessionsStarted: sessions.length,
    wordsAttempted: vocabStats.wordsAttempted,
    wordsCorrect: vocabStats.wordsCorrect,
    gemsEarned: sessions.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.gems_total, 0),
    lastPlayedAt: sessions[0]?.created_at,
    timeSpent: sessions.reduce((sum, s) => sum + (s.duration_seconds || 0), 0)
  };
}
```

### **Solution 4: Assignment-Level Progress**

```typescript
function calculateAssignmentProgress(activities: GameProgress[]) {
  if (activities.length === 0) return 0;
  
  // Weight each activity by its progress
  const totalProgress = activities.reduce((sum, activity) => {
    return sum + activity.progressPercentage;
  }, 0);
  
  return Math.round(totalProgress / activities.length);
}
```

**Example:**
- Game 1: 0% (not started)
- Game 2: 45% (in progress, 2 sessions)
- Game 3: 100% (completed)
- Game 4: 30% (in progress, 1 session)
- Game 5: 0% (not started)

**Overall Progress: (0 + 45 + 100 + 30 + 0) / 5 = 35%**

## Database Queries Needed

### Get Game Sessions
```sql
SELECT 
  game_type,
  COUNT(*) as session_count,
  SUM(gems_total) as total_gems,
  SUM(words_attempted) as words_attempted,
  SUM(words_correct) as words_correct,
  AVG(accuracy_percentage) as avg_accuracy,
  SUM(duration_seconds) as total_time,
  MAX(created_at) as last_played
FROM enhanced_game_sessions
WHERE assignment_id = ? AND student_id = ?
GROUP BY game_type;
```

### Get Vocabulary Progress
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT vocabulary_item_id) as unique_words_practiced,
  SUM(total_encounters) as total_encounters,
  SUM(correct_encounters) as correct_encounters,
  SUM(incorrect_encounters) as incorrect_encounters
FROM vocabulary_gem_collection
WHERE student_id = ?;
```
