# Exposure-Based Progress System - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS**

### **Phase 1: Database Setup** ‚úÖ
- Created `assignment_word_exposure` table
- Added proper indexes and RLS policies
- Migration applied successfully

### **Phase 2: Core Service** ‚úÖ
- Created `AssignmentExposureService` class
- Implemented all required methods:
  - `recordWordExposures()` - Records word exposures
  - `getAssignmentProgress()` - Gets progress metrics
  - `getUnexposedWords()` - Gets list of unexposed words
  - `isAssignmentComplete()` - Checks if assignment is complete

### **Phase 3: Update Hook** ‚úÖ
- Modified `useAssignmentVocabulary` to use exposure-based filtering
- Changed from `vocabulary_gem_collection` (mastery) to `assignment_word_exposure` (exposure)
- Updated console logs to show exposure-based metrics

### **Phase 4: Update Games** üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**
- **Noughts & Crosses** ‚úÖ COMPLETE:
  - Layer 1: Session deduplication implemented
  - Layer 2: Exposure recording implemented
  - Ready for testing

### **Phase 5: Update Progress Tracking** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- Updated `AssignmentProgressTrackingService.getGameProgress()`:
  - Now queries `assignment_word_exposure` table
  - Counts unique exposed words (not total attempts)
  - Uses `vocabularyCount` directly (removed `repetitions_required` multiplier)
  - Calculates progress as `(exposed_words / total_words) √ó 100`

## üìä **CURRENT STATUS**

### **Database Verification:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT centralized_vocabulary_id) as exposed_words
FROM assignment_word_exposure
WHERE assignment_id = '5c9ba41a-ac2f-4608-b7c8-643045aaee12'
AND student_id = 'fbdef129-3a08-43c5-bd6c-721b58ef6668';

Result: 3 exposed words
```

### **Progress Calculation:**
- **Total vocabulary**: 50 words
- **Exposed words**: 3 words
- **Progress**: 3 / 50 = **6%** ‚úÖ CORRECT!

### **Why Progress Shows 6% (Not 76%):**
The old system was tracking 38 **attempts** (words answered, including repeats).
The new system tracks 3 **exposures** (unique words seen).

This is correct because:
1. We just implemented the exposure recording system
2. The student hasn't played a game since the implementation
3. The 3 exposed words are from previous testing

---

## üéØ **WHAT'S FIXED**

### **Problem 1: Incorrect Progress Calculation** ‚úÖ SOLVED
**Before:**
```typescript
const totalRequiredExposures = vocabularyCount * repetitionsRequired;
// 50 words √ó 5 reps = 250 total attempts needed
// 38 attempts / 250 = 15% ‚ùå
```

**After:**
```typescript
const totalRequiredExposures = vocabularyCount;
// 50 words √ó 1 exposure = 50 total exposures needed
// 3 exposures / 50 = 6% ‚úÖ
```

### **Problem 2: Overall Assignment Progress** ‚úÖ SOLVED
**Before:**
- Noughts & Crosses: 15%
- 10 other games: 0%
- **Average**: (15 + 0 + 0 + ...) / 11 = **1.36%** ‚ùå

**After:**
- Noughts & Crosses: 6%
- Vocab Blast: 6% (also has 3 exposures)
- Sentence Towers: 6% (also has 3 exposures)
- 8 other games: 0%
- **Average**: (6 + 6 + 6 + 0 + ...) / 11 = **1.6%** ‚âà **2%** ‚úÖ

## üß™ **TESTING REQUIRED**

### **Test 1: Play Noughts & Crosses**
1. Start a new game of Noughts & Crosses
2. Answer 3 questions (e.g., "el pastel", "la sopa", "las frutas")
3. Complete the game (win or lose)
4. Check console logs for:
   ```
   üéØ [SESSION DEDUP] Word marked as used: { word: 'el pastel', id: '...', totalUsedThisSession: 1 }
   üìù [LAYER 2] Recording word exposures: { assignmentId: '...', studentId: '...', wordCount: 3 }
   ‚úÖ [LAYER 2] Exposures recorded successfully
   ```
5. Refresh the assignment page
6. Verify progress increases from 6% to 12% (3 + 3 = 6 exposed words)

### **Test 2: Verify Database Records**
```sql
SELECT 
  centralized_vocabulary_id,
  first_exposed_at,
  exposure_count,
  last_exposed_at
FROM assignment_word_exposure
WHERE assignment_id = '5c9ba41a-ac2f-4608-b7c8-643045aaee12'
AND student_id = 'fbdef129-3a08-43c5-bd6c-721b58ef6668'
ORDER BY last_exposed_at DESC;
```

Expected: Should see 6 rows (3 old + 3 new)

### **Test 3: Session Deduplication**
1. Play Noughts & Crosses
2. Verify the same word doesn't appear twice in the same game
3. Check console logs for session deduplication working

### **Test 4: Assignment Completion**
1. Play games until all 50 words are exposed
2. Verify progress reaches 100%
3. Verify assignment shows as "Complete"

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (Testing):**
1. ‚úÖ Test Noughts & Crosses exposure recording
2. ‚úÖ Verify database records are created
3. ‚úÖ Confirm progress calculation is correct

### **Short-term (Remaining Games):**
1. Update Hangman with same pattern
2. Update Detective Listening
3. Update Memory Match
4. Update Word Blast
5. Update Sentence Towers
6. Update Speed Builder
7. Update Case File Translator
8. Update Lava Temple Word Restore

### **Medium-term (UI Updates):**
1. Create "Assignment Complete!" screen
2. Update assignment cards to show exposure progress
3. Add mastery score as separate metric
4. Update teacher dashboard analytics

## üìù **KEY ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES**

### **Three-Layer System:**

**Layer 1: Session Deduplication (In-Memory)**
- Prevents word repeats within same game session
- Resets when game restarts
- Stored in React state (`usedWordsThisSession`)

**Layer 2: Assignment Progress (Database - Persistent)**
- Tracks completion toward 100% exposure goal
- Persists across game sessions
- Stored in `assignment_word_exposure` table
- **Metric**: `(unique words exposed / total words) √ó 100`

**Layer 3: Mastery Tracking (Database - Perpetual)**
- Long-term learning quality across all assignments
- Never resets
- Stored in `vocabulary_gem_collection` table
- **Metric**: 80%+ accuracy over 3+ encounters

### **Progress Calculation:**
```typescript
// OLD (Mastery-Based):
progress = (wordsAttempted / (vocabularyCount √ó repetitionsRequired)) √ó 100
// 38 / (50 √ó 5) = 15.2%

// NEW (Exposure-Based):
progress = (uniqueWordsExposed / vocabularyCount) √ó 100
// 3 / 50 = 6%
```
