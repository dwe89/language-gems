### **Risk Score Algorithm:**
```typescript
riskScore = (
  lowAccuracy * 0.25 +        // <60% accuracy
  lowEngagement * 0.25 +       // <5 sessions
  decliningTrend * 0.2 +       // Performance dropping
  inactivity * 0.2 +           // >7 days since last activity
  masteryStagnation * 0.1      // Placeholder for future
)
```
