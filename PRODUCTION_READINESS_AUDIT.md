# LanguageGems Production Readiness Audit

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This comprehensive audit evaluates the production readiness of the LanguageGems platform, identifying critical issues, testing gaps, and providing actionable recommendations for a successful production deployment.

## ✅ Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Authentication & Profile Loading Issues
**Severity: HIGH** → **Status: ✅ RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: Teacher profile loading failures in `/account/page.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect table names and nested async operations
- **Solution**: Fixed database queries, corrected table names (`class_enrollments` vs `students_in_classes`), improved error handling
- **Verification**: All authentication tests now pass (100% success rate)

### 2. Memory Game Session Tracking Issues
**Severity: MEDIUM** → **Status: 🔍 UNDER INVESTIGATION**
- **Issue**: Multiple memory game sessions showing 0 gems earned and 0 accuracy
- **Current Status**: Requires deeper investigation of game completion logic
- **Impact**: Student progress tracking may be affected
- **Next Steps**: Detailed game session analysis needed

### 3. Student Dashboard Cross-Domain Access
**Severity: LOW** → **Status**: 🟢 ACCEPTABLE
- **Issue**: Student dashboard accessed on main domain instead of subdomain
- **Assessment**: Currently functional, optimization can be done post-launch
- **Impact**: Minimal - does not affect core functionality
