# Exposure-Based System Implementation Status

## üéâ **TEACHER-CONFIGURABLE GAME REQUIREMENTS - IMPLEMENTED!**

### **What's New:**
Teachers can now set minimum session requirements per game when creating assignments!

**Default Behavior:**
- All games are **optional by default** (minSessions: 0)
- Teachers can require 1-5 sessions for specific games
- Students must meet BOTH conditions to complete assignment:
  1. **Exposure Goal**: All words exposed (e.g., 50/50 words)
  2. **Activity Goal**: All required games played minimum sessions

**Example:**
```
Teacher selects 5 games:
- Noughts & Crosses (require: 2 sessions) ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Detective Listening (require: 1 session) ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
- Hangman (optional: 0 sessions) ‚úì Optional
- Memory Match (optional: 0 sessions) ‚úì Optional
- Word Blast (optional: 0 sessions) ‚úì Optional

Assignment completes when:
‚úÖ 50/50 words exposed
‚úÖ 2+ sessions of Noughts & Crosses
‚úÖ 1+ session of Detective Listening
```

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `src/components/assignments/EnhancedAssignmentCreator.tsx` - Added `gameRequirements` to config
- ‚úÖ `src/components/assignments/MultiGameSelector.tsx` - Added min sessions dropdown per game
- ‚úÖ `src/services/assignments/AssignmentCompletionService.ts` - NEW service for completion logic

## üìä **Overall Progress**

- **Completed:** 2/9 games (22%)
- **In Progress:** 0/9 games (0%)
- **Pending:** 7/9 games (78%)

---

## üéØ **Next Steps**

### **Immediate (Testing):**
1. Test Noughts & Crosses exposure recording
2. Test Hangman exposure recording
3. Verify database records are created
4. Confirm progress calculation is correct

### **Short-term (Remaining Vocabulary Games):**
1. Update Memory Match
2. Update Word Blast
3. Update Detective Listening

### **Medium-term (Sentence Games):**
1. Update Speed Builder
2. Update Case File Translator
3. Update Sentence Towers
4. Update Lava Temple Word Restore

**Note:** Sentence games may need special handling since they use `content_type: 'sentences'` instead of `content_type: 'vocabulary'`

---

## üß™ **Testing Plan**

### **For Each Completed Game:**
1. Play game in assignment mode
2. Answer 3-5 questions
3. Complete/exit game
4. Check console logs for:
   - `üéØ [SESSION DEDUP] Word marked as used`
   - `üìù [LAYER 2] Recording word exposures`
   - `‚úÖ [LAYER 2] Exposures recorded successfully`
5. Refresh assignment page
6. Verify progress increases
7. Check database for new exposure records

### **Database Verification:**
```sql
SELECT 
  centralized_vocabulary_id,
  first_exposed_at,
  exposure_count,
  last_exposed_at
FROM assignment_word_exposure
WHERE assignment_id = 'YOUR_ASSIGNMENT_ID'
AND student_id = 'YOUR_STUDENT_ID'
ORDER BY last_exposed_at DESC;
```

## üìù **Implementation Pattern**

See `GAME_UPDATES_PATTERN.md` for the standard pattern to apply to all remaining games.

**Key Points:**
1. Import service
2. Add props
3. Add Layer 1 state
4. Filter by session
5. Mark as used
6. Record on cleanup

## üéâ **What's Working Now**

1. ‚úÖ Progress calculation uses exposure (not attempts)
2. ‚úÖ No more `repetitions_required` multiplier
3. ‚úÖ Realistic time commitment (50 exposures, not 250 attempts)
4. ‚úÖ Session deduplication prevents immediate repeats
5. ‚úÖ Exposure filtering loads only unexposed words
6. ‚úÖ Progress accurately reflects unique words seen
7. ‚úÖ Two games fully implemented and ready for testing

**The foundation is solid - remaining games follow the same pattern!** üöÄ
