Bright, cartoonish style suitable for educational games. 400x300 pixels.
```

### **Speed Builder** (`speed-builder.jpg`) 
```
Create a game screenshot showing words like "The", "cat", "runs", "fast" being dragged and dropped to form a sentence. Include construction/building theme elements like cranes or building blocks.

```

### **Word Blast** (`word-blast.jpg`)

Create a space-themed game screenshot with rockets and explosions. Words should be flying around or being blasted, with colorful particle effects. Include elements like rockets launching and word targets being hit. Action-packed but educational style. 400x300 pixels.
```

### **Sentence Towers** (`sentence-towers.jpg`)

## üìã **Alternative: Use Screenshots**

If you want actual game screenshots instead of designed graphics:

1. **Play each game** in the browser
2. **Take a screenshot** of the most exciting/representative moment
3. **Crop to 400x300px** (4:3 aspect ratio) 
4. **Save as JPG** with the exact filenames above
5. **Place in** `/public/images/games/`

**Best screenshot moments:**
- **Gem Collector**: Mid-game with gems falling and score visible
- **Speed Builder**: Words being dragged to form sentences  
- **Word Blast**: Action moment with explosions/effects
- **Sentence Towers**: Multiple word towers built up
- **Hangman**: Puzzle in progress with some letters filled in
