## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Unified Integration Pattern**
```typescript
// Every game uses the same pattern:
const { recordWordPractice, algorithm } = useUnifiedSpacedRepetition('game-name');

// In answer handlers:
const fsrsResult = await recordWordPractice(
  wordData,      // { id, word, translation, language }
  isCorrect,     // boolean
  responseTime,  // milliseconds
  confidence     // 0.1 to 0.95
);
```

### **Smart Confidence Scoring System**
Each game implements sophisticated confidence calculations:

- **Base Confidence**: Game-type specific (0.4-0.8)
- **Response Time**: Faster responses = higher confidence
- **Game Mode**: Typing > Multiple Choice > Audio
- **Difficulty Factors**: Complex tenses, context clues, streak bonuses
- **Error Penalties**: Wrong answers, replays, slow responses

### **Assignment Mode Respect**
- FSRS only records in free-play mode
- Assignment mode preserves existing analytics
- No interference with teacher reporting

### **Error Handling & Logging**
- Graceful fallback if FSRS recording fails
- Detailed console logging for debugging
- Performance metrics tracking
