# ðŸš€ Easy SEO Title Fix for Language Gems

## The Problem
Your site currently shows mostly generic titles like "Language Gems - Interactive GCSE Language Learning Games & Vocabulary Platform" across different pages, which hurts SEO.

## ðŸ“ˆ The Simple Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Improve the Root Layout Default Title
Update your root layout to have a better default title that's more specific to your homepage.

### Step 2: Add Page-Specific Titles to Key Pages
Focus on the most important pages that don't currently have metadata:
- Main pages (Terms, Assessments, Contact, etc.)
- Game pages  
- Resource pages

### Step 3: Use Dynamic Titles for Templates
For pages that use templates (like individual games), create dynamic title generation.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Methods

### Method 1: Quick Wins (Server Components)
For pages that are already server components, add metadata directly:

```tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next';
import { generateMetadata } from '../../components/seo/SEOWrapper';

export const metadata: Metadata = generateMetadata({
  title: 'Your Optimized Title Here',
  description: 'Your page description',
  canonical: '/your-page-route'
});
```

### Method 2: Root Layout Template Update  
Update the default title in `src/app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    default: 'GCSE Language Learning Games | Interactive Vocabulary Platform | Language Gems',
    template: '%s | Language Gems'
  },
  // ... rest of metadata
}
```

### Method 3: Client Component Pages
For client component pages, convert them to server components where possible, or use Next.js dynamic metadata.
