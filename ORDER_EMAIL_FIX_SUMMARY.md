# 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Order Confirmation Emails

## Problem Discovered

**Your website was telling customers "Download links have been emailed to you" but NO EMAILS were actually being sent!**

### Impact
- **Every customer who purchased since launch** did NOT receive their download links via email
- Customers could only access downloads by:
  1. Staying on the success page immediately after purchase
  2. Logging into their account and viewing orders
- This is a **critical customer experience issue** and likely caused support requests

---

## Root Cause

The Stripe webhook handler (`src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`) was:
1. ✅ Creating orders in the database
2. ✅ Creating order items
3. ✅ Clearing the user's cart
4. ❌ **NOT sending any confirmation email**

The same issue existed in the free order endpoint (`src/app/api/orders/create-free-order/route.ts`).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Brevo Email Template (ID: 15)
- **Template Name**: "Order Confirmation - Download Links"
- **Subject**: "Your LanguageGems Order - Download Your Resources"
- **Sender**: support@languagegems.com
- **Tag**: order-confirmation

**Template Features**:
- Professional branded design matching your LanguageGems style
- Order details (Order #, Date, Total)
- Download buttons for each purchased product
- Instructions on how to access resources
- Link to account dashboard for future access
- Support contact information

### 2. Added Email Sending Function
Created `sendOrderConfirmationEmail()` function that:
- Fetches product details from the database
- Generates download links for each product
- Formats order information (date, total, etc.)
- Sends email via Brevo API using template ID 15
- Includes proper error handling (won't break order if email fails)

### 3. Integrated Email Sending
**Modified Files**:
1. `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` - Sends email after successful payment
2. `src/app/api/orders/create-free-order/route.ts` - Sends email for free orders

## What Customers Will Now Receive

When a customer completes a purchase, they will receive an email with:

1. **Order Confirmation Header** - "Order Confirmed! 🎉"
2. **Order Details**:
   - Order number
   - Order date
   - Total amount paid
3. **Download Links** - Individual download buttons for each product
4. **Access Instructions**:
   - How to download files
   - Link to account dashboard for future access
5. **Support Information** - How to get help if needed

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test the Fix:
1. **Create a test purchase** using Stripe test mode
2. **Check that email is sent** to the customer email
3. **Verify download links work** in the email
4. **Test free orders** to ensure they also send emails

### Monitor:
- Check Brevo dashboard for email delivery stats
- Monitor webhook logs for any email sending errors
- Watch for customer support requests about missing emails

## For Past Customers (October 6th onwards)

**You may want to:**
1. Query the database for all orders since October 6th
2. Manually send order confirmation emails to those customers
3. Or create a script to resend emails to past orders

**SQL to find affected customers**:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  customer_email,
  customer_name,
  created_at,
  total_cents
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= '2024-10-06'
  AND status = 'completed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
