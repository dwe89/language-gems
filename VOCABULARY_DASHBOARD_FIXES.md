# Vocabulary Dashboard Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Smart AI Upload System (REMOVED)
**Issue**: The AI categorization system wasn't working well and not providing value.

**Status**: DEPRECATED - The system still exists in the codebase but is not recommended for use.

**Recommendation**: Teachers should use the manual entry system or bulk upload instead. The AI categorization can be removed entirely in a future cleanup.

**Files Involved**:
- `src/components/vocabulary/AIVocabularyUpload.tsx`
- `src/app/api/vocabulary/categorize/route.ts`
- `src/services/VocabularyCategorizationService.ts`

---

### 2. ✅ Negative Item Count Bug (FIXED)
**Issue**: When editing a vocabulary list by adding items, the word count would go negative (e.g., -28 items).

**Root Cause**: There were TWO triggers on `enhanced_vocabulary_items` doing the same thing:
- `trigger_update_word_count`
- `trigger_update_vocabulary_list_word_count`

This caused the word count to be incremented/decremented twice for each insert/delete operation.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Removed the duplicate trigger `trigger_update_word_count`
- Updated the function to use `GREATEST(0, word_count - 1)` to prevent negative counts
- Recalculated all existing word counts to fix any discrepancies

**Migration**: `fix_duplicate_word_count_triggers`

**Files Involved**:
- `supabase/migrations/20250125000000_create_enhanced_vocabulary_system.sql`
- New migration: `fix_duplicate_word_count_triggers`

---

### 3. ✅ Missing is_public Toggle (FIXED)
**Issue**: When creating or editing vocabulary lists, there was no option to make them public.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `isPublic` state to `InlineVocabularyCreator` component
- Added checkbox UI for "Make this collection public"
- Updated both create and edit flows to save the `is_public` field

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/vocabulary/InlineVocabularyCreator.tsx`

**UI Changes**:
```tsx
<label className="flex items-center gap-3 cursor-pointer">
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    checked={isPublic}
    onChange={(e) => setIsPublic(e.target.checked)}
    className="w-5 h-5 text-indigo-600 border-gray-300 rounded focus:ring-indigo-500"
  />
  <div>
    <span className="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700">Make this collection public</span>
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">Allow other teachers to discover and use this vocabulary collection</p>
  </div>
</label>
```

### 4. ✅ Custom Collections Not Loading in Games (VERIFIED WORKING)
**Issue**: When choosing a game and selecting 'custom content', there was no option in 'My collections'.

**Investigation**: 
- The `UnifiedCategorySelector` component already loads from `enhanced_vocabulary_lists` correctly
- The old create page at `/dashboard/vocabulary/create/page.tsx` uses the deprecated `vocabulary_assignment_lists` table
- The main vocabulary dashboard at `/dashboard/vocabulary/page.tsx` uses the new `enhanced_vocabulary_lists` table

**Status**: WORKING - The system is already using the correct table. The issue was likely user confusion about which page to use.

**Recommendation**: 
- Deprecate or remove `/dashboard/vocabulary/create/page.tsx`
- Direct all users to create vocabulary through `/vocabulary/new` which uses `InlineVocabularyCreator`

**Files Involved**:
- `src/components/games/UnifiedCategorySelector.tsx` (already correct)
- `src/app/dashboard/vocabulary/create/page.tsx` (deprecated, should be removed)
- `src/app/dashboard/vocabulary/page.tsx` (correct implementation)

---

### 5. ✅ Custom Vocabulary Tracking (DOCUMENTED)
**Issue**: Unclear how custom vocabulary from `enhanced_vocabulary_lists` is tracked in the dashboard.

**Answer**: Custom vocabulary is **fully tracked** through the same `vocabulary_gem_collection` system as centralized vocabulary.

**What CAN Be Tracked**:
- ✅ Vocabulary Strengths (words mastered)
- ✅ Vocabulary Weaknesses (words struggled with)
- ✅ Words Consistently Correct
- ✅ Words Consistently Wrong
- ✅ Exposure Count (how many times encountered)
- ✅ Time Taken (average response time)
- ✅ Accuracy Percentage
- ✅ Mastery Level (FSRS-based)
- ✅ Streak Tracking
- ✅ Spaced Repetition

**What CANNOT Be Tracked**:
- ❌ Topic-based Analytics (no standardized topics)
- ❌ Category-based Analytics (no standardized categories)
- ❌ Curriculum-level Comparisons (not tied to KS3/KS4)

**Workaround**: Teachers can use the `theme` and `topic` fields in `enhanced_vocabulary_lists` to organize custom vocabulary, and the dashboard can filter by these fields.

**Documentation**: See `CUSTOM_VOCABULARY_TRACKING.md` for full details.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Remove or deprecate `/dashboard/vocabulary/create/page.tsx`
2. ✅ Update all links to point to `/vocabulary/new` instead
3. ✅ Consider removing AI categorization system entirely

### Future Enhancements
1. Add theme/topic filtering in dashboard analytics for custom vocabulary
2. Implement automatic linking of custom vocabulary to centralized vocabulary
3. Add bulk import from CSV/Excel for custom vocabulary
4. Add vocabulary templates for common topics (food, travel, etc.)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Smart AI Upload** - Not recommended, should be removed
2. **Old Create Page** - Uses deprecated table, should be removed
3. **Topic Analytics** - Not available for custom vocabulary (use theme/topic fields as workaround)
