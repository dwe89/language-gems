# Database Security Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Assessment Date:** August 11, 2025  
**Database:** Language Gems Supabase Database  
**Auditor:** AI Security Analysis Tool

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified **multiple critical and high-risk vulnerabilities** in the database configuration that could lead to unauthorized data access, data breaches, and potential system compromise. Immediate action is required to address these security gaps.

## üö® CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### 1. Anonymous Public Access to Sensitive Data (CRITICAL)

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to student assessment data

**Affected Tables:**
- `aqa_dictation_assignments` - Policy: "Allow anonymous access to dictation assignments" (qual: `true`)
- `aqa_dictation_results` - Policy: "Allow anonymous access to dictation results" (qual: `true`)
- `aqa_dictation_question_responses` - Policy: "Allow anonymous access to dictation responses" (qual: `true`)

**Details:** These policies allow ANYONE (including unauthenticated users) to read ALL data in these tables, including:
- Student assignment data
- Student test results
- Individual question responses
- Performance analytics

**Recommendation:** Immediately restrict these policies to authenticated users only and implement proper user-based access controls.

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Completely Disabled (CRITICAL)

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete data exposure

**Affected Tables (33 tables):**
- `achievements`, `aqa_reading_assessments`, `aqa_reading_questions`, `aqa_topic_assessments`
- `aqa_topic_questions`, `class_vocabulary_assignments`, `demo_users`
- `edexcel_listening_assessments`, `edexcel_listening_questions`, `edexcel_listening_results`
- `exam_assignments`, `exam_boards`, `feature_usage`, `gcse_*` tables (6 tables)
- `lesson_plans`, `order_items`, `orders`, `organization_members`
- `school_codes`, `sentence_*` tables (3 tables), `storage_objects`
- `subscription_plans`, `subscriptions`, `teacher_feedback`, `user_assessment_progress`
- `user_settings`, `user_subscriptions`, `vocabulary_id_mapping`
- Backup tables (4 tables)

**Details:** These tables have NO access controls whatsoever. Anyone with database access can read, modify, or delete ALL data.

**Recommendation:** Enable RLS on all tables and implement appropriate policies immediately.

## üî• HIGH-RISK VULNERABILITIES

### 3. Overly Permissive RLS Policies (HIGH)

**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Unauthorized data access

**Problematic Policies:**
- `centralized_vocabulary` - Multiple policies with `qual: true` allowing unrestricted access
- `aqa_listening_audio_cache` - All operations allowed for authenticated users (`qual: true`)
- `assignments` - Public read access for all authenticated users (`qual: true`)
- `assessment_leaderboards` - Public viewing for all users (`qual: true`)

**Details:** These policies provide blanket access without proper user-based restrictions.

### 4. RLS Enabled But No Policies (HIGH)

**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Tables are effectively locked down (better than exposed, but breaks functionality)

**Affected Tables (16 tables):**
- `exam_style_questions`, `exam_style_results`, `reading_assessment_results`
- `reading_assessments`, `reading_comprehension_assignments`, `reading_comprehension_results`
- `reading_passages`, `reading_questions`, `sentence_attempts`, `student_classes`
- `user_reading_comprehension_stats`, `user_reading_stats`

**Details:** These tables have RLS enabled but no policies defined, making them inaccessible even to legitimate users.

### 5. Security Definer Views (HIGH)

**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Privilege escalation

**Affected Views:**
- `worksheet_download_analytics`
- `teacher_dashboard_stats`
- `gcse_vocabulary_complete`
- `ai_insights_api`
- `assignment_completion_status`
- `student_gem_analytics`

**Details:** These views run with creator privileges instead of user privileges, potentially allowing privilege escalation.

### 6. RLS Policies Exist But RLS Disabled (HIGH)

**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Security policies not enforced

**Affected Tables:**
- `aqa_reading_assessments` - Has 3 policies but RLS disabled
- `aqa_reading_questions` - Has 3 policies but RLS disabled
- `aqa_topic_assessments` - Has 2 policies but RLS disabled
- `aqa_topic_questions` - Has 2 policies but RLS disabled

**Details:** Security policies defined but not enforced due to disabled RLS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM-RISK VULNERABILITIES

### 7. Function Search Path Issues (MEDIUM)

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Potential SQL injection via function calls

**Details:** 79 functions have mutable search_path, making them vulnerable to search path manipulation attacks.

### 8. Authentication Configuration Issues (MEDIUM)

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Account takeover

**Issues:**
- OTP expiry set to more than 1 hour (recommended: less than 1 hour)
- Leaked password protection disabled (should check against HaveIBeenPwned)

### 9. Sensitive Data in User-Accessible Tables (MEDIUM)

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Information disclosure

**Tables with sensitive columns:**
- `user_profiles` - Contains `initial_password` field
- `purchases` - Contains `download_token`
- Various auth tables contain tokens and secrets (properly protected by auth schema)

## üìä Vulnerability Statistics

- **Total Tables Reviewed:** 90+ tables
- **Tables with RLS Disabled:** 33 (37%)
- **Tables with Anonymous Access:** 3 (3%)
- **Tables with Overly Permissive Policies:** 15+ (17%)
- **Security Definer Views:** 6
- **Functions with Security Issues:** 79

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION REQUIRED

### Priority 1 (Fix Immediately)
1. **Remove anonymous access policies** from dictation tables
2. **Enable RLS** on all 33 unprotected tables
3. **Fix RLS-disabled tables** that have policies

### Priority 2 (Fix Within 24 Hours)
1. **Review and restrict overly permissive policies**
2. **Add policies to RLS-enabled tables** without policies
3. **Review security definer views** and convert to security invoker where appropriate

### Priority 3 (Fix Within 1 Week)
1. **Fix function search paths** with `SET search_path = ''`
2. **Enable leaked password protection** in auth settings
3. **Reduce OTP expiry** to less than 1 hour
4. **Review and secure sensitive data columns**

## üí° Security Best Practices Recommendations

1. **Implement Defense in Depth**
   - Enable RLS on ALL public tables
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Implement proper user role segregation

2. **Access Control Strategy**
   - Teachers should only access their own classes/students
   - Students should only access their own data
   - Anonymous users should have very limited read access

3. **Data Classification**
   - Classify sensitive data (PII, assessment results, etc.)
   - Implement appropriate protection levels
   - Regular access audits

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Implement database access logging
   - Set up alerts for unusual access patterns
   - Regular security assessments

## üéØ Sample Secure Policy Implementation

```sql
-- Example: Secure the assignments table
ALTER TABLE assignments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Teachers can only see their own assignments
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can view own assignments" ON assignments
    FOR SELECT USING (created_by = auth.uid());

-- Students can only see assignments in their classes
CREATE POLICY "Students can view class assignments" ON assignments
    FOR SELECT USING (
        class_id IN (
            SELECT class_id FROM class_enrollments 
            WHERE student_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

## ‚ö° Critical Action Items

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Disable anonymous access to assessment data
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Enable RLS on all unprotected tables
3. **TODAY:** Audit all user access patterns
4. **TODAY:** Implement proper teacher/student data segregation
5. **THIS WEEK:** Complete security hardening of all tables
