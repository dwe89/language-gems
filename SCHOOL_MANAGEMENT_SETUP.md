# School Management System - Complete Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **User Setup - danieletienne89@gmail.com**
**Problem**: User showed "No school associated with user"

**Solution**: 
- Created school code `LGDEMO` for "Language Gems Demo School"
- Set user as school owner with `is_school_owner = true`
- Automatically created school membership via database trigger

**Database Changes**:
```sql
-- School created
INSERT INTO school_codes (code, school_name, is_active)
VALUES ('LGDEMO', 'Language Gems Demo School', true);

-- User updated to school owner
UPDATE user_profiles
SET school_code = 'LGDEMO', is_school_owner = true
WHERE email = 'danieletienne89@gmail.com';

-- School membership auto-created by trigger
-- Result: User is now owner of LGDEMO school
```

### 2. **School Management Card on Account Page**
**Problem**: School Management card only showed for school owners, not all premium users

**Solution**: 
- Updated `/account` page to show School Management card for ALL premium teachers
- Card is now visible at `http://localhost:3000/account` for premium users
- Prominent green gradient card with school management features

**Changes Made**:
- Modified condition from `isTeacher && hasSubscription && schoolInfo?.isOwner` to `isTeacher && hasSubscription`
- All premium teachers can now access school management
- Non-owners will be guided to create their school

### 3. **Teacher Invitation System with Brevo Email Integration**
**Problem**: Adding teachers didn't send emails or create accounts

**Solution**: Created complete teacher invitation workflow with Brevo email integration

**New API Endpoint**: `/api/school/invite-teacher`

**Features**:
1. **For Existing Teachers** (already have Language Gems account):
   - Automatically adds them to the school
   - Sends welcome email via Brevo
   - Notifies them they've been added
   - No signup required

2. **For New Teachers** (don't have account yet):
   - Sends beautiful invitation email via Brevo
   - Includes signup link with pre-filled school code
   - Provides school code for manual entry
   - Guides them through signup process

**Email Templates**:
- **Invitation Email**: For new teachers with signup link
- **Welcome Email**: For existing teachers added to school
- Both use professional HTML templates with Language Gems branding
- Sent via Brevo API with proper authentication

### 4. **Database Schema Fixes**
**Problem**: Foreign key relationship error in school_memberships query

**Solution**:
- Fixed API to manually join `school_memberships` with `user_profiles`
- Removed broken foreign key reference
- Now properly fetches member details

## üìã How It Works

   - View list of all teachers in school
   - See member roles (owner/member)

3. **Add Teachers**:
   - Enter teacher's email address
   - Click "Add Teacher"

   - Click remove button next to teacher
   - Confirm removal
   - Teacher is unlinked from school

2. System doesn't find account
3. Sends invitation email via Brevo with:

   - Signup link with pre-filled data
   - Instructions
4. Teacher clicks link ‚Üí signup page
5. School code pre-filled

```
