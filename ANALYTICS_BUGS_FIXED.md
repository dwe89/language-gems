# Analytics Bugs Fixed - October 2, 2025

## Summary
Fixed three critical analytics bugs that were causing incorrect data display across the teacher dashboard and vocabulary analytics.

---

## Bug #1: Vocabulary Analytics Percentage Display (10000%, 5000%)

### Issue
Vocabulary analytics was showing impossible percentages like 10000% and 5000% for word accuracy.

### Root Cause
The service (`teacherVocabularyAnalytics.ts`) was already calculating and returning accuracy as a percentage (0-100), but the UI component was multiplying by 100 again.

### Example
```typescript
// Service (line 839)
accuracy: Math.round(accuracy * 100) / 10  // Returns 100 for 100%

// UI (line 460) - BUG
{(word.accuracy * 100).toFixed(0)}%  // Displays 10000%!
```

### Files Modified
- `src/services/teacherVocabularyAnalytics.ts` (no changes needed - was correct)
- `src/components/teacher/TeacherVocabularyAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` (6 locations fixed)

### Changes Made
Removed the multiplication by 100 in all UI display locations:

**Before:**
```typescript
{(word.accuracy * 100).toFixed(0)}%
```

**After:**
```typescript
{word.accuracy.toFixed(0)}%
```

**Affected Lines:**
- Line 460: Strong words display
- Line 487: Weak words display  
- Line 830: Progress bar width
- Line 833: Progress bar label
- Line 878: Mastered words progress bar
- Line 881: Mastered words label
- Line 950: Student strong words
- Line 974: Student weak words

### Testing
‚úÖ Verify vocabulary analytics now shows correct percentages (0-100%)
‚úÖ Check both strong and weak words displays
‚úÖ Verify student-specific word details

## Bug #2: Assignment Progress "0 of 0 students"

### Issue
Assignment analysis page was showing "0 of 0 students" even when students were enrolled in the class.

### Root Cause
The API was only counting students who had made progress (`enhanced_assignment_progress` table), not all enrolled students from the class.

### Example
```typescript
// OLD (BUGGY) CODE
const studentIds = [...new Set(allProgress.map(p => p.student_id))];
const totalStudents = studentIds.length;  // Only counts students who started!
```

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/teacher-analytics/assignment-analysis/route.ts`

### Changes Made

1. **Fetch all enrolled students from the class:**
```typescript
// Get ALL enrolled students from the class
const { data: enrolledStudents } = await supabase
  .from('class_enrollments')
  .select('student_id')
  .eq('class_id', assignment.class_id)
  .eq('status', 'active');

const allStudentIds = enrolledStudents?.map(e => e.student_id) || [];
```

2. **Updated student performance mapping:**
```typescript
// Build student performance list for ALL enrolled students
const studentPerformance = allStudentIds.map(studentId => {
  const studentProgress = allProgress.filter(p => p.student_id === studentId);
  const latestProgress = studentProgress.length > 0
    ? studentProgress.sort((a, b) => 
        new Date(b.updated_at).getTime() - new Date(a.updated_at).getTime()
      )[0]
    : null;

  return {
    studentId,
    studentName: studentMap.get(studentId) || 'Unknown Student',
    status: latestProgress ? latestProgress.status : 'not-started',
    score: latestProgress && latestProgress.status === 'completed' ? latestProgress.score : null,
    timeSpentMinutes: latestProgress && latestProgress.time_spent_seconds
      ? Math.round(latestProgress.time_spent_seconds / 60) 
      : null,
    attempts: studentProgress.length,
    lastAttempt: latestProgress ? new Date(latestProgress.updated_at) : null
  };
});
```

3. **Fixed type issues:**
   - Added proper AssignmentAnalysisData structure
   - Fixed question breakdown types
   - Added backward compatibility layer for UI

### Testing
‚úÖ Verify assignment shows total enrolled students, not just those who started
‚úÖ Check that students with "not-started" status appear in the list
‚úÖ Verify completion rate calculation is correct

---

## Bug #3: "Last active: never" for Logged-in Users

### Issue
Many student accounts showing "Last active: never" even though they had recently logged in and played games.

### Root Cause (To be investigated)
The `last_encountered_at` field in `vocabulary_gem_collection` table is likely not being updated when students interact with vocabulary through games.

### Investigation Needed
1. ‚úÖ Check vocabulary tracking in game sessions
2. ‚úÖ Verify database triggers/functions for `last_encountered_at`
3. ‚úÖ Check if `user_profiles.last_seen` is updated separately
4. ‚úÖ Review game completion handlers

### Recommended Fix (Not yet implemented)
Need to ensure that game sessions properly update the `last_encountered_at` timestamp:

```typescript
// In game completion/vocabulary interaction handlers:
await supabase
  .from('vocabulary_gem_collection')
  .update({
    last_encountered_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    total_encounters: currentEncounters + 1,
    correct_encounters: isCorrect ? currentCorrect + 1 : currentCorrect
  })
  .eq('student_id', studentId)
  .eq('centralized_vocabulary_id', wordId);
```

### Status
üîç **Requires further investigation** - Need to trace vocabulary update logic through game sessions.

## Impact

### High Priority (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ **Bug #1**: Resolved - Teachers can now see accurate performance metrics
- ‚úÖ **Bug #2**: Resolved - Assignment analytics now show correct student counts

### Medium Priority (Under Investigation)
- üîç **Bug #3**: Needs investigation - "Last active" tracking

## Testing Checklist

### Vocabulary Analytics
- [ ] Load vocabulary analytics page
- [ ] Verify percentages are between 0-100%
- [ ] Check strong words display
- [ ] Check weak words display
- [ ] Verify student word details
- [ ] Test with different classes

### Assignment Progress
- [ ] Load assignment analysis page
- [ ] Verify total student count matches class enrollment
- [ ] Check that "not-started" students appear
- [ ] Verify completion rate calculation
- [ ] Test with assignments that have partial completion

### Last Active (Future)
- [ ] Play a vocabulary game as a student
- [ ] Check if last_encountered_at updates
- [ ] Verify teacher dashboard reflects recent activity
- [ ] Test with different game types

## Deployment Notes

1. **No database migrations required** - Only code changes
2. **No breaking changes** - Backward compatible
3. **Safe to deploy** - Fixes display bugs only

## Files Changed
```
src/components/teacher/TeacherVocabularyAnalyticsDashboard.tsx
src/app/api/teacher-analytics/assignment-analysis/route.ts
```

## Next Steps
1. Deploy these fixes to production
2. Monitor analytics for correct display
3. Investigate Bug #3 (last active tracking)
4. Add E2E tests for analytics display
