# Unified Assignment System Testing Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This guide provides step-by-step testing procedures to validate the unified vocabulary assignment system implementation across all Language Gems games.

## âœ… Pre-Testing Setup

### Database Verification
1. **Check Migration Status**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify curriculum level columns exist
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'assignments' AND column_name = 'curriculum_level';

   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'centralized_vocabulary' AND column_name = 'curriculum_level';

   -- Verify KS4-specific columns exist
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'centralized_vocabulary'
   AND column_name IN ('tier', 'theme_name', 'exam_board_code', 'is_required');
   ```

2. **Verify Sample Data**:
   ```sql
   -- Check assignments have curriculum levels
   SELECT curriculum_level, COUNT(*) FROM assignments GROUP BY curriculum_level;

   -- Check vocabulary has curriculum levels
   SELECT curriculum_level, COUNT(*) FROM centralized_vocabulary GROUP BY curriculum_level;

   -- Verify KS4 vocabulary migration
   SELECT curriculum_level, tier, COUNT(*) FROM centralized_vocabulary
   WHERE curriculum_level = 'KS4' GROUP BY curriculum_level, tier;
   ```
