# Students Subdomain Setup Guide

## Current Implementation Status ✅

Your `students.languagegems.com` subdomain is now fully configured in the codebase! Here's what's been implemented:

### 1. Middleware Configuration
- ✅ Detects `students.` subdomain automatically
- ✅ Routes student portal content correctly
- ✅ Handles authentication redirects based on user roles
- ✅ Redirects students to appropriate domain based on their role

### 2. Student Portal Structure
```
/student/                    # Student portal landing page
├── page.tsx                # Main student login interface
├── layout.tsx              # Student-specific layout
├── auth/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Auth layout for student domain
│   └── login/
│       └── page.tsx        # Student login handler
└── dashboard/
    └── page.tsx            # Dashboard redirect handler
```

### 3. Smart Routing Logic
- **students.languagegems.com** → Student portal landing
- **students.languagegems.com/student-dashboard** → Full student dashboard
- **students.languagegems.com/auth/login** → Student-optimized login
- **languagegems.com/student** → Redirects to student subdomain

### 4. User Experience Flow
1. **Student visits** `students.languagegems.com`
2. **Sees clean, student-focused** welcome page
3. **Clicks login** → redirected to main auth with student context
4. **After login** → automatically taken to student dashboard
5. **Teacher visits student subdomain** → redirected to main site

## Next Steps: Domain Configuration

### For Local Testing

#### Step 1: Update your hosts file
Add this line to `/etc/hosts`:
```bash
127.0.0.1       students.localhost
```

**How to edit hosts file:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
3. Add the line: `127.0.0.1       students.localhost`
4. Save with `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`

#### Step 2: Test the subdomain
- **Main site**: `http://localhost:3003` → Teacher-focused homepage
- **Student portal**: `http://students.localhost:3003` → Student portal

#### Step 3: Verify the flow
1. Visit `http://students.localhost:3003`
2. Should see student-focused welcome page
3. Click "Sign In & Play" 
4. Should redirect with student context

### For Production Deployment

**Your nameservers are already on Vercel, so this is simple!**

#### 1. Vercel Domain Setup (Only step needed!)
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Domains**  
3. Add domain: `students.languagegems.com`
4. Vercel will automatically create all DNS records

#### 2. ~~DNS Configuration~~ ❌ **SKIP THIS**
~~Since your nameservers are on Vercel, you don't need to touch Porkbun!~~
Vercel handles all DNS automatically when you add the domain.

#### 3. SSL Certificate
- Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates
- `students.languagegems.com` will be HTTPS-enabled within minutes

### Testing Checklist

Once DNS propagates (usually 5-10 minutes):

- [ ] `students.languagegems.com` loads student portal
- [ ] Student login redirects properly
- [ ] Student dashboard works on subdomain
- [ ] Teacher access redirects to main site
- [ ] Authentication persists across domains

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Brand Clarity**: Main domain stays 100% teacher-focused
✅ **User Experience**: Students have dedicated, intuitive portal
✅ **Professional Architecture**: Industry-standard subdomain separation
✅ **Single Codebase**: All functionality in one repository
✅ **Future-Proof**: Easy to scale and maintain

Your student portal is ready for production! 🚀
