# Duplicate Game Sessions - Root Cause Analysis & Fix

## 🚨 Problem Summary

The teacher dashboard leaderboard was showing **massively inflated statistics** for students:
- Raelan Mcaree showed **4,190 game sessions** and **85.2 hours** of play time
- This was **physically impossible** - 85 hours in a single day (Oct 2, 2025)
- Students in top positions showed **0 points** despite being ranked #1, #2, #3

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What We Found

1. **Massive Duplicate Records**
   - 952 duplicate groups (unique combinations of student + game + timestamp)
   - 3,943 total duplicate records
   - 2,991 records needed deletion
   - Maximum 754 duplicates in a single group (Raelan's word-towers session)

2. **Identical Timestamps**
   - All 755 duplicate sessions had the **EXACT SAME `started_at` timestamp**: `2025-10-02 11:10:58.662`
   - All had identical scores (3543), accuracy (100%), and game type (word-towers)
   - This proves ONE game session was recorded 755 times in the database

3. **Incomplete Test Data**
   - 3,420 sessions with no `ended_at` timestamp (82% of Raelan's sessions)
   - These were bulk-imported test sessions that never completed
   - Created by test data seeding scripts

4. **Test Student Identification**
   - Students had auto-generated emails with timestamps: `raelan.mcaree.1759399676014@student.languagegems.com`
   - Created on Oct 2, 2025 at 10:08 AM via bulk student creation API
   - Sessions started at 11:03 AM (about 1 hour later)

### How It Happened

**Most Likely Cause**: Test data seeding scripts (`scripts/create-realistic-test-data.js`, `scripts/create-test-data-for-dashboard.js`, or `scripts/create-working-test-data.js`) were either:
1. Run multiple times accidentally
2. Had a bug causing duplicate inserts
3. Encountered errors and retried the same inserts

**Evidence**:
- No database triggers that could cause duplication (only `update_updated_at_column` on UPDATE)
- Application code has retry logic but only for general operations, not session creation
- Batch insert scripts exist that insert sessions in batches of 15-50

## ✅ Complete Fix Implementation

### 1. Database-Level Protection ✅

**Migration**: `prevent_duplicate_game_sessions`

Added unique constraint to prevent duplicate sessions:
```sql
ALTER TABLE enhanced_game_sessions
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_game_session_per_student 
UNIQUE (student_id, game_type, started_at);
```

**Result**: Database now **physically prevents** the same session from being inserted twice.

### 2. Cleanup Duplicate Data ✅

**Migration**: `cleanup_duplicate_game_sessions`

Removed 2,991 duplicate records:
- Kept the first occurrence of each unique session (by `created_at` and `id`)
- Deleted all subsequent duplicates
- Verified no duplicates remain

**Before Cleanup**:
- Raelan: 4,174 total sessions, 757 completed, 85.2 hours

**After Cleanup**:
- Raelan: 3,424 total sessions, 4 completed, 0.3 hours (18 minutes)
- Removed 750 duplicate sessions
- Remaining 3,420 incomplete sessions are filtered out by leaderboard logic

### 3. Application-Level Deduplication ✅

**File**: `src/services/rewards/EnhancedGameSessionService.ts`

Added error handling for duplicate session attempts:
```typescript
if (error.code === '23505' && error.message?.includes('unique_game_session_per_student')) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Duplicate session detected, prevented by database constraint');
  
  // Try to find the existing session instead of creating a duplicate
  const { data: existingSession } = await this.supabase
    .from('enhanced_game_sessions')
    .select('id')
    .eq('student_id', sessionData.student_id)
    .eq('game_type', sessionData.game_type)
    .eq('started_at', startedAt)
    .single();
  
  if (existingSession) {
    return existingSession.id; // Use existing session
  }
}
```

**Result**: If a duplicate insert is attempted, the app gracefully handles it and uses the existing session.

### 4. Leaderboard Filtering Improvements ✅

**Files**: 
- `src/services/leaderboards/TeacherLeaderboardsService.ts`
- `src/app/dashboard/leaderboards/page.tsx`
- `src/components/leaderboards/CrossGameLeaderboard.tsx`

**Filters Applied**:
1. **Only completed sessions**: `.not('ended_at', 'is', null)`
2. **Reasonable durations**: `duration_seconds > 0 AND duration_seconds <= 7200` (max 2 hours)
3. **Data quality validation**: Flags days with >8 hours or >100 sessions
4. **Hide inactive students**: Optional filter to exclude students with 0 points

## 📊 Results

### Before Fix
- **Raelan Mcaree**: 4,190 games, 85.2 hours, 264,100 points
- **Leaderboard**: Top students showing 0 points
- **Data Quality**: Physically impossible statistics

### After Fix
- **Raelan Mcaree**: 4 valid games, 0.3 hours (18 min), realistic stats
- **Leaderboard**: Accurate rankings with real data
- **Data Quality**: All statistics are now realistic and validated
- **Protection**: Database constraint prevents future duplicates

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

1. **Database Constraint**: `UNIQUE (student_id, game_type, started_at)` - prevents duplicates at DB level
2. **Application Handling**: Graceful error handling for duplicate attempts
3. **Data Validation**: Multi-layer filtering in leaderboard service
4. **Quality Warnings**: UI displays warnings for suspicious data patterns

## 🔧 Recommendations

1. **Clean Up Test Data**: Consider deleting or archiving the 3,420 incomplete test sessions
2. **Test Data Scripts**: Review and fix the seeding scripts to prevent future issues
3. **Monitoring**: Add alerts for unusual session creation patterns
4. **Documentation**: Update test data creation procedures to prevent script re-runs

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_cleanup_duplicate_game_sessions.sql` - Cleanup migration
2. `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_unique_constraint_game_sessions.sql` - Constraint migration
3. `src/services/rewards/EnhancedGameSessionService.ts` - Application-level deduplication
4. `src/services/leaderboards/TeacherLeaderboardsService.ts` - Data quality filtering (already done)
5. `src/app/dashboard/leaderboards/page.tsx` - UI improvements (already done)
6. `src/components/leaderboards/CrossGameLeaderboard.tsx` - Warning display (already done)

## ✅ Verification

Run this query to verify the fix:
```sql
-- Should return 0 duplicate groups
SELECT COUNT(*) as duplicate_groups
FROM (
  SELECT student_id, game_type, started_at, COUNT(*) as cnt
  FROM enhanced_game_sessions
  GROUP BY student_id, game_type, started_at
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) duplicates;
```

Expected result: `duplicate_groups: 0`

## 🎯 Conclusion

**Root Cause**: Test data seeding scripts created massive duplicate records due to script re-runs or bugs.

**Permanent Fix**: Three-layer protection:
1. Database constraint prevents duplicates
2. Application handles duplicate attempts gracefully
3. Leaderboard filters ensure only valid data is displayed

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All duplicates removed, constraints in place, application protected.
