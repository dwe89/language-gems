## üéÆ Game Integration Architecture

### 1. Unified Game Interface

**Every game implements:**
```typescript
interface GameInterface {
  // Configuration
  configure(config: GameConfig): void;
  loadVocabulary(words: VocabularyItem[]): void;
  
  // Lifecycle
  startGame(): void;
  pauseGame(): void;
  endGame(): GameResult;
  
  // Progress Tracking
  onWordAttempt(callback: WordAttemptCallback): void;
  onGameEvent(callback: GameEventCallback): void;
  
  // State Management
  getGameState(): GameState;
  saveProgress(): SessionData;
}

interface WordAttemptCallback {
  (data: {
    wordId: string;
    correct: boolean;
    responseTime: number;
    attempts: number;
    hintsUsed: number;
  }): void;
}
```

### 2. Progress Tracking Integration

**Real-time tracking for each word:**
```typescript
const trackWordAttempt = (wordData: WordAttempt) => {
  // Update student_vocabulary_progress
  updateWordProficiency(wordData);
  
  // Log detailed performance
  logWordPerformance(wordData);
  
  // Update spaced repetition schedule
  calculateNextReview(wordData);
  
  // Check achievements
  checkForAchievements(wordData);
};
```
