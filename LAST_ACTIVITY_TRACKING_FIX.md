# Last Activity Tracking Fix

## Issue Description
Teachers were seeing "Last active: never" for students who had actively played vocabulary games (enhanced_game_sessions records existed), but had no entries in the `vocabulary_gem_collection` table.

### Example Case
**Class**: 8S/SP (ID: 624ad38e-d79a-4187-b9e6-c49ba0d78cc3)
**Affected Students**:
- Adrian Wasowski: 9 game sessions (last: 2025-10-02 11:22:17), 0 vocabulary items → showing "never"
- Amelia Thistlethwaite: 6 game sessions (last: 2025-10-02 11:29:52), 0 vocabulary items → showing "never"
- Eva Berrow: 16 game sessions (last: 2025-10-02 11:23:26), 0 vocabulary items → showing "never"

## Root Cause
The `getStudentVocabularyProgress()` function in `TeacherVocabularyAnalyticsService` only calculated `lastActivity` from the `vocabulary_gem_collection.last_encountered_at` field:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (lines 317-322)
const lastActivity = gems.reduce((latest, g) => {
  if (!g.last_encountered_at) return latest;
  const encounterDate = new Date(g.last_encountered_at);
  return !latest || encounterDate > latest ? encounterDate : latest;
}, null as Date | null);
```

**Problem**: Students who played games but didn't collect vocabulary gems had no `vocabulary_gem_collection` entries, so `lastActivity` was always `null`, displaying as "never" in the UI.

## Solution
Added fallback logic to check `enhanced_game_sessions.created_at` when a student has no vocabulary collection data.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Filter Students Without Vocabulary Data (lines 276-281)
```typescript
// Identify students without any vocabulary data
const studentsWithoutVocab = students.filter(student => 
  !gems.some(gem => gem.student_id === student.id)
);
```

#### 2. Query Game Sessions for These Students (lines 283-298)
```typescript
// For students without vocabulary data, check game sessions
const gameSessionsByStudent = new Map<string, Date>();
if (studentsWithoutVocab.length > 0) {
  const { data: gameSessions, error: gameError } = await this.supabase
    .from('enhanced_game_sessions')
    .select('student_id, created_at')
    .in('student_id', studentsWithoutVocab.map(s => s.id))
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

  if (!gameError && gameSessions) {
    // Keep the most recent game session per student
    gameSessions.forEach(session => {
      if (!gameSessionsByStudent.has(session.student_id)) {
        gameSessionsByStudent.set(session.student_id, new Date(session.created_at));
      }
    });
  }
}
```

#### 3. Use Fallback in lastActivity Calculation (line 356)
```typescript
// OLD: lastActivity: lastActivity,
// NEW:
lastActivity: lastActivity || gameSessionsByStudent.get(student.id) || null,
```

### Type Fixes
Also fixed several TypeScript errors encountered during implementation:

1. **Line 482**: Added explicit type annotation for `vocabularyDetails` array
2. **Line 520**: Added null check to skip vocabulary items without required `category` or `curriculum_level`
3. **Line 236**: Added type assertion for Supabase join result (`classes` object)

## Files Modified
- `/src/services/teacherVocabularyAnalytics.ts` - Core fix implementation

## Testing
### Expected Behavior
Students who have played games (have `enhanced_game_sessions` records) but haven't collected vocabulary gems will now show their last game session date as "Last active" instead of "never".

### Test Query
```sql
-- Verify students with game sessions but no vocabulary data
SELECT 
  up.user_id,
  up.display_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT egs.id) as game_sessions_count,
  MAX(egs.created_at) as last_game_session,
  COUNT(DISTINCT vgc.id) as vocabulary_items_collected,
  MAX(vgc.last_encountered_at) as last_vocab_activity
FROM user_profiles up
JOIN class_enrollments ce ON up.user_id = ce.student_id
LEFT JOIN enhanced_game_sessions egs ON up.user_id = egs.student_id
LEFT JOIN vocabulary_gem_collection vgc ON up.user_id = vgc.student_id
WHERE ce.class_id = '624ad38e-d79a-4187-b9e6-c49ba0d78cc3'
  AND ce.status = 'active'
GROUP BY up.user_id, up.display_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT egs.id) > 0 AND COUNT(DISTINCT vgc.id) = 0
ORDER BY last_game_session DESC;
```

## Future Considerations
### Deeper Investigation Needed
This fix addresses the **symptom** (missing lastActivity data) but not the **root cause** (why `vocabulary_gem_collection` isn't being populated when students play games).

**Questions to investigate**:
1. Why aren't vocabulary gems being created when students play games?
2. Are game session handlers properly updating the `vocabulary_gem_collection` table?
3. Is there a missing trigger or service call in the game completion flow?

**Suggested next steps**:
- Review game session handlers (check where `enhanced_game_sessions` records are created)
- Trace vocabulary gem collection update logic
- Add logging to identify why gems aren't being collected for some students
- Consider if certain game types don't create vocabulary gems (and if that's intended)

## Impact
- **Teachers** will now see accurate "last active" dates for all students who have engaged with the platform
- **Analytics** will be more reliable for tracking student engagement
- **User Experience** improved - no more confusing "never" labels for active students
