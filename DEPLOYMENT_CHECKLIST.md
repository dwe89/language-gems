curl -s https://languagegems.com/sitemap.xml | grep -c "dashboard\|admin\|account"

# Check robots.txt
curl -s https://languagegems.com/robots.txt | head -20
```

### 3. Google Search Console Actions

#### A. Submit Updated Sitemap
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Select your property: `languagegems.com`
3. Navigate to: **Sitemaps** (left sidebar)
4. If old sitemap exists, click the three dots → **Remove sitemap**
5. Click **Add a new sitemap**
6. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
7. Click **Submit**
8. Wait 5-10 minutes, refresh page
9. Verify: "72 URLs discovered" (not 3,178)

#### B. Request Indexing for Priority Blog Post
1. In Google Search Console, go to **URL Inspection** (top search bar)
2. Enter: `https://languagegems.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-aqa-speaking-exam`
3. Click **Test Live URL**
4. Wait for test to complete (should show "URL is available to Google")
5. Click **Request Indexing**
6. Confirm the request

#### C. Request Indexing for Top 5 Blog Posts (Optional but Recommended)
Repeat the URL Inspection process for:
1. `/blog/ser-vs-estar-ultimate-guide-students`
2. `/blog/por-vs-para-guide`
3. `/blog/german-cases-explained-simple-guide`
4. `/blog/complete-guide-gcse-spanish-vocabulary-themes`
5. `/blog/gcse-spanish-speaking-exam-tips`

**Note**: Google limits indexing requests, so spread these out over 1-2 days if needed.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Day 1 (Deployment Day)
- [ ] Verify sitemap accessible: `https://languagegems.com/sitemap.xml`
- [ ] Check sitemap shows 72 URLs in Google Search Console
- [ ] Confirm robots.txt updated: `https://languagegems.com/robots.txt`
- [ ] Request indexing for priority blog post

### Day 2-3
- [ ] Check GSC Coverage Report: Note current "Discovered – currently not indexed" count
- [ ] Monitor Sitemaps Report: Check how many URLs Google has crawled
- [ ] Request indexing for 3-5 more high-priority blog posts

### Week 1
- [ ] GSC Coverage: "Discovered – currently not indexed" should start decreasing
- [ ] GSC Sitemaps: Most of 72 URLs should be crawled
- [ ] GSC Performance: Monitor impressions for blog posts (should increase)

### Week 2-4
- [ ] GSC Coverage: "Discovered – currently not indexed" should drop below 50
- [ ] GSC Index Coverage: 60-70 pages indexed (out of 72 in sitemap)
- [ ] Organic traffic to blog posts should increase 20-50%

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Sitemap still shows 3,178 URLs
**Solution**: 
- Clear Vercel cache
- Redeploy: `vercel --prod`
- Wait 10 minutes, check again

### Issue: Dashboard pages still appearing in Google
**Solution**:
- Go to GSC → Removals
- Request removal for URL pattern: `https://languagegems.com/dashboard/*`
- Repeat for `/admin/*`, `/account/*`, `/student-dashboard/*`

### Issue: Blog posts not getting indexed
**Solution**:
- Check internal linking: Add links from homepage to blog
- Verify blog posts have proper metadata (title, description, canonical)
- Request indexing manually in GSC
- Add "Related Posts" section to increase internal links

### Issue: "Discovered – currently not indexed" not decreasing
**Solution**:
- Wait 2-4 weeks (Google needs time to recrawl)
- Improve internal linking to priority pages
- Add fresh content (new blog posts)
- Check for technical issues (page speed, mobile-friendliness)

## Success Criteria

After 4 weeks, you should see:

✅ **Sitemap**: 72 URLs (down from 3,178)
✅ **Indexed Pages**: 60-70 pages (up from ~50)
✅ **Discovered – Not Indexed**: <20 pages (down from 312)
✅ **Blog Post Impressions**: +50-100% increase
✅ **Crawl Efficiency**: Google focuses on /blog, /grammar, /games

## Next Steps After Success

1. **Content Strategy**
   - Publish 2-4 new blog posts per month
   - Update existing posts with fresh examples
   - Create more grammar reference pages

2. **Internal Linking**
   - Add "Related Posts" to all blog posts
   - Link from homepage to top 5 blog posts
   - Create topic clusters (e.g., "GCSE Spanish" hub page)

3. **Technical SEO**
   - Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
   - Improve Core Web Vitals
   - Add FAQ schema to blog posts

4. **Link Building**
   - Share blog posts in MFL teacher communities
   - Guest post on education blogs
