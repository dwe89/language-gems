# Hangman Assignment Canvas & Keyboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Canvas Too Large for Screen ✅

**Problem:** 
- The hangman canvas was too large and didn't adapt to different screen sizes in assignment mode
- Used fixed `max-w-[min(560px,100%)]` which was too big for the responsive layout
- No height constraint on mobile devices

**Solution:**
- Removed fixed max-width constraint
- Made canvas fully responsive with `max-w-full` and `h-full`
- Added responsive aspect ratios:
  - Mobile: `aspect-[4/5]` (portrait-friendly)
  - Medium screens: `aspect-[3/4]` 
  - Large screens: `aspect-square`
- Added `max-h-[400px]` constraint on mobile for the canvas container
- Canvas now scales properly within the flexbox layout

**Changes in `ClassicHangmanAnimation.tsx`:**
```tsx
// Before:
className="... max-w-[min(560px,100%)] aspect-[4/5] lg:aspect-square ..."

// After:
className="... max-w-full h-full aspect-[4/5] md:aspect-[3/4] lg:aspect-square ..."
```

**Changes in `HangmanGame.tsx`:**
```tsx
// Before:
<div className="w-full md:flex-[3] flex items-center justify-center">

// After:
<div className="w-full md:flex-[3] flex items-center justify-center max-h-[400px] md:max-h-none">
```

### 2. Missing œ (OE ligature) for French ✅

**Problem:**
- French keyboard layout was missing the œ symbol
- Common in French words like "cœur" (heart), "sœur" (sister), "œuf" (egg), "bœuf" (beef)

**Solution:**
- Added 'Œ' to French accented letters array

**Change in `HangmanGame.tsx`:**
```tsx
case 'french':
  // Before:
  accentedLetters = ['É', 'È', 'Ê', 'À', 'Ç'];
  
  // After:
  accentedLetters = ['É', 'È', 'Ê', 'À', 'Ç', 'Œ'];
  break;
```

## How It Works Now

### Responsive Canvas Sizing

1. **Mobile (< 768px):**
   - Canvas height constrained to 400px max
   - Portrait aspect ratio (4:5) for better fit
   - Full width within container

2. **Tablet (768px - 1024px):**
   - No height constraint
   - Moderate aspect ratio (3:4)
   - Takes up 3/5 of flexbox space

3. **Desktop (> 1024px):**
   - Square aspect ratio
   - Full canvas display
   - Scales with available space

### French Keyboard Letters

Now includes all common French special characters:
- **É** - e acute
- **È** - e grave  
- **Ê** - e circumflex
- **À** - a grave
- **Ç** - c cedilla
- **Œ** - oe ligature (NEW!)

The keyboard automatically splits letters into two rows for better organization.
