## üé¨ Video Tutorial Script: Creating Your First Assignment

**Welcome to LanguageGems, the interactive platform where language learning comes to life. In this guide, we'll walk you through creating your very first assignment, starting with the fast, focused Quick Assignment.**

From your main Teacher Dashboard, locate and click the Assignments tab in the left-hand menu. Then, click the large blue + Create New Assignment button at the top right of the screen.

Here, you'll see two options: **Quick Assignment** for a simple single-activity task, and **Comprehensive Assignment** for advanced assignments that combine games, grammar exercises, assessments, and worksheets for complete learning experiences. Since this is your first time, let's choose the Quick Assignment.

A simple creation form will appear. First, give your assignment a clear Name, like 'Spanish Food Vocabulary Practice'. Then, add a brief Description for your students, and select the specific class or individuals you wish to target.

Next, you will choose your content. Under Vocabulary Source, you can select a Theme or Topic, or choose one of your own Custom Lists. Once your words are selected, pick your Game Type. Since Quick Assignments are single-activity, we'll choose a quick game like Memory Match.

Finally, define the basic parameters. Use the calendar tool to set the Due Date and adjust the target score.

When you're ready, click Submit.

That's it! Your assignment is now live, and your students are notified. For more comprehensive learning units that mix games like VocabMaster and Conjugation Duel with grammar exercises, assessments, and worksheets, and require specific curriculum alignment, remember to choose the **Comprehensive Assignment** option next time.

You can now use the Progress Tracking feature to monitor student performance on your new assignment.
