# Strongest Topics/Subjects Fix

## Problem

**Before:** "Strongest Subjects" displayed meaningless game types like "multi-game"
- Used `game_type` from assignments (vocabulary, multi-game, etc.)
- This doesn't tell students anything useful about their actual learning progress
- "multi-game" is not a subject or topic students care about

## Solution

**After:** "Strongest Topics" displays actual vocabulary topics with language context
- Uses real vocabulary performance data from `word_performance_logs` and `centralized_vocabulary`
- Shows topics like "FR - Food & Drink", "ES - School", "DE - Family"
- Gives actionable insight into what topics students are excelling at

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed Function and Logic
**File:** `src/components/student/AssignmentProgressTracker.tsx`

**Old function:**
```typescript
analyzeSubjectPerformance(submissions: any[])
// Used game_type from assignments
// Returned generic game types
```

**New function:**
```typescript
analyzeTopicPerformance(userId: string)
// Queries word_performance_logs with centralized_vocabulary
// Returns actual vocabulary topics with language prefix
// Requires at least 3 attempts per topic for statistical relevance
```

### 2. Data Source Changed

**Before:**
- Source: `assignments.game_type` via submissions
- Example output: `["multi-game", "vocabulary"]`

**After:**
- Source: `word_performance_logs` joined with `centralized_vocabulary`
- Example output: `["FR - Food & Drink", "ES - Travel", "DE - Numbers"]`

### 3. UI Updates

**Labels changed:**
- "Strongest Subjects" → "Strongest Topics"
- "Areas for Improvement" → "Topics to Practice"

**Display format:**
- Shows language code prefix (FR, ES, DE)
- Shows actual topic name from curriculum
- Smaller font size to accommodate longer topic names

### 4. Performance Calculation

**Metric:** Accuracy percentage by topic
```typescript
// Groups by: `${language.toUpperCase()} - ${topic_name}`
// Calculates: (correct_attempts / total_attempts) * 100
// Filters: Only topics with >= 3 attempts
// Sorts: Highest accuracy first
```

**Strongest Topics:** Top 3 by accuracy
**Topics to Practice:** Topics with <70% accuracy (up to 3)

## Benefits

1. **Actionable Insights:** Students see exactly which vocabulary topics they're good at
2. **Language-Specific:** Clearly shows which language and topic combination
3. **Accurate Representation:** Based on actual word-by-word performance, not game type
4. **Motivation:** Seeing specific topics builds confidence and directs practice

## Example Output

**Before:**
- Strongest Subjects: "multi-game", "vocabulary"

**After:**
- Strongest Topics: 
  - "FR - Food & Drink" (95% accuracy)
  - "ES - School" (87% accuracy)
  - "DE - Numbers" (82% accuracy)

## Data Requirements

For topics to appear:
- Student must have attempted words from that topic (at least 3 times)
- Data must exist in `word_performance_logs` table
- Words must be linked to `centralized_vocabulary` with `topic_name` set

## Future Enhancements

Could add:
- Show accuracy percentage next to each topic
- Add attempt count indicator
- Link to practice that specific topic
- Show progress over time for each topic
