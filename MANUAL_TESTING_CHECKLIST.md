### 3. Security & Error Handling
- [ ] **Authorization Checks:**
  - [ ] As a student, attempt to access teacher-only pages directly via URL. Verify access is denied.
  - [ ] As Teacher A, attempt to view/edit another teacher's class/assignment data via URL manipulation. Verify unauthorized access is prevented.
  - [ ] As Student A, attempt to view another student's personal progress data via URL manipulation. Verify unauthorized access is prevented.
- [ ] **Session Management:**
  - [ ] After logging in, close the browser tab/window without logging out. Reopen and verify session state (e.g., remembered vs. logged out).
  - [ ] Log in on one device/browser, then try to log in on another with the same credentials. Observe concurrent session behavior.
- [ ] **Input Sanitization (Manual Attempt):**
  - [ ] In all text input fields (e.g., class names, descriptions, profile info), try entering simple HTML tags (e.g., `<b>bold</b>`, `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`).
  - [ ] After saving, view the content to verify that the HTML/script is not rendered or executed and is properly escaped/sanitized.
- [ ] **Error Message Disclosure:**
  - [ ] Intentionally trigger errors (e.g., invalid login attempts, malformed data if possible).
  - [ ] Verify that error messages are generic and do not leak sensitive information (e.g., database errors, server paths).
- [ ] **Network Issues:**
  - [ ] Test offline functionality (if applicable for any part of the app).
  - [ ] Test slow network conditions.
  - [ ] Verify clear error messages for network failures.
  - [ ] Test recovery after network restoration.
- [ ] **Data Validation:**
  - [ ] Test all form validation rules (e.g., required fields, min/max length, valid formats).
  - [ ] Test boundary conditions for numerical inputs (e.g., minimum/maximum points for an assignment).
  - [ ] Check clarity and helpfulness of validation error messages.

### 4. Accessibility Testing (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - [ ] Verify all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields, game controls) are reachable and operable using only the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Spacebar, arrow keys).
  - [ ] Check for clear and visible focus indicators on all interactive elements.
  - [ ] Ensure no keyboard traps exist (users can navigate away from any element).
- [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:**
  - [ ] Navigate through key pages (dashboard, assignment list, a game) using a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).
  - [ ] Verify that all meaningful images have appropriate `alt` text.
  - [ ] Check that form fields have proper labels explicitly associated with them.
  - [ ] Ensure dynamic content updates (e.g., game scores, progress updates) are announced by the screen reader.
  - [ ] Verify proper heading structure (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) is used for semantic navigation.
- [ ] **Color Contrast:**
  - [ ] Visually inspect various pages for sufficient contrast between text and background, and between interactive elements and their background (aim for WCAG AA).
- [ ] **Zoom Functionality:**
  - [ ] Test browser zoom up to 200% without loss of content or functionality (no horizontal scrolling required for normal reading).

### 5. Localization/Internationalization (If UI language switching is implemented)
- [ ] **Language Switching (UI):**
  - [ ] If a UI language selector exists, switch between available languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French, German).
  - [ ] Verify that all static UI elements (buttons, menus, labels) update correctly to the selected language.
  - [ ] Check that dynamic messages (e.g., "Assignment Completed!") also translate appropriately.
  - [ ] Verify that date and number formats adapt to the selected locale (if applicable).
