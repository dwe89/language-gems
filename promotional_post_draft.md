# Promotional Post Drafts

Here are a few options for your post, ranging from a personal story to a feature-focused announcement.

## Option 1: The "Teacher's Pain Point" (Best for LinkedIn/Facebook)
**Headline: Finally, Analytics That Actually Help Me Teach**

For years, I have wanted to be able to use a service which actually tells me **WHAT** words and **WHAT** topic my students are struggling in, rather than just giving me "percentages" of a topic which does not help.

Knowing that my class has a "70% score" in *Family & Relationships* is useless. I need to know *why*.

That's exactly what we've built with the new Analytics Dashboard on Language Gems. No more guessing.

Now, I can drill down instantly:
✅ **Filter by Topic:** Select "Holidays" or "School" to see exactly how we're doing.
✅ **Sort by "Struggling":** Immediately see which words have the highest failure rate across the class.
✅ **See the Common Mistakes:** It’s not just that they got it wrong—I can see *how* they got it wrong.

Example: I don't just see a low score; I see that 8 students are confusing *'llamar'* (to call) with *'llamarse'* (to be called).

That is actionable. That allows me to walk into class tomorrow and say, *"Right everyone, let's fix this specific confusion."*

Real data for real teaching.

## Option 2: Short & Punchy (Best for Twitter/X/Instagram)
**Headline: Stop Guessing. Start Targeting.**

Generic "topic scores" are dead. 💀

Teachers need granular data. That's why we launched our new Deep Dive Analytics.

Now you can filter your entire class performance by:
🔍 **Topic** (Drill down into specific units)
📉 **Struggling Students** (See who needs help instantly)
❌ **Mistake Patterns** (Identify the exact words tripping everyone up)

Don't just teach the topic. Teach the **gaps**.

## Option 3: The "Features" Focus (Newsletter/Email)
**Subject: New Feature: See EXACTLY what your students are struggling with**

Hi teachers,

We've removed the guesswork from your grading.

Our new **Vocabulary Analytics Dashboard** goes beyond simple percentages. We've built a powerful filtering engine that lets you slice your class data any way you need:

*   **By Topic:** isolate specific areas of the curriculum.
*   **By Struggling Words:** Sort instantly to see the "Top 10 Hardest Words" for your specific class.
*   **By Accuracy & Mistakes:** Differentiate between a simple slip-up and a genuine learning gap.

We even categorize words as **Proficient**, **Learning**, or **Struggling** based on *both* accuracy and exposure—so you don't waste time reviewing words they simply haven't seen enough yet.

Teaching is hard enough. Your data should make it easier.
