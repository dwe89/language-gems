-- ASSIGNMENT PROGRESS TRACKING MIGRATION VERIFICATION SCRIPT
-- ============================================================================
-- This script verifies that the assignment progress tracking consolidation
-- was successful and all components are working correctly.

-- ============================================================================
-- 1. VERIFY DATA MIGRATION
-- ============================================================================

-- Check data consistency across all progress tables
