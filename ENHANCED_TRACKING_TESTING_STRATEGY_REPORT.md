### 🔍 **Tracking Classification Validation**

**✅ SKILL-BASED GAMES (Correct Implementation)**:
- VocabMaster: Session + Word Performance Logs ✅
- Detective Listening: Session + Word Performance Logs ✅
- Sentence Towers: Session + Enhanced Tracking ✅
- Word Towers: Session + Enhanced Tracking ✅

**✅ LUCK-BASED GAMES (Correct Implementation)**:
