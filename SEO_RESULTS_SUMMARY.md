## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### HIGH PRIORITY - Client Component Pages That Need Manual Updates

These pages have client-side functionality but are important for SEO:

1. **`/games`** - Current: Generic title  
   → Target: "15+ GCSE Language Learning Games | Language Gems"

2. **`/help-center`** - Current: Generic title  
   → Target: "Help Center | Support & FAQs | Language Gems"

3. **`/tutorials`** - Current: Generic title  
   → Target: "Getting Started Guide | Language Gems Tutorials for Teachers"

4. **`/contact-sales`** - Current: Generic title  
   → Target: "Contact Sales | School Pricing & Demos | Language Gems for Schools"

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Game Pages

Individual game pages that would benefit from specific titles:
- `/games/vocabulary-mining` → "Vocabulary Mining Game | Interactive Word Learning | Language Gems"
- `/games/hangman` → "Language Learning Hangman | GCSE Vocabulary Game | Language Gems"
- `/games/memory-game` → "Memory Match Game | Visual Vocabulary Learning | Language Gems"

### LOW PRIORITY - Dashboard & Admin Pages

These should have `noindex` metadata to prevent search engine indexing:
- All `/dashboard/*` pages
- All `/student-dashboard/*` pages  
- All `/admin/*` pages
- All `/auth/*` pages

---

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS

### Option A: Manual Updates (Fastest)
For each client component page that needs a custom title:

1. **Add a layout file** in the page directory with metadata
2. **Or use Next.js dynamic metadata** with the `generateMetadata` function

### Option B: Create Custom Hook (Scalable)
Create a `usePageTitle` hook that sets the document title for client components.

### Option C: Page-Level Layout Files (Recommended)
Create layout.tsx files in specific page directories to override metadata.
