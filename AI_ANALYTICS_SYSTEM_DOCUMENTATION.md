## Overview

The LanguageGems AI Analytics System is a comprehensive, proactive analytics platform that identifies struggling students before they fall behind, surfaces critical insights automatically, and provides actionable recommendations to teachers. This system transforms passive reporting into proactive intervention.

**🚀 KEY ACHIEVEMENT**: The dashboard is now truly proactive - critical insights are prominently displayed at the top with clear call-to-actions, eliminating the need for teachers to search through tables to find problems.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Proactive AI Dashboard** (`src/components/dashboard/ProactiveAIDashboard.tsx`)
   - Primary interface that surfaces critical insights prominently
   - Real-time metrics and alerts
   - Actionable recommendations with clear call-to-actions

2. **Student Data Service** (`src/services/studentDataService.ts`)
   - Aggregates real student data from multiple database tables
   - Calculates risk indicators and performance metrics
   - Provides comprehensive student analytics

3. **AI Insights Service** (`src/services/aiInsightsService.ts`)
   - Generates AI-powered insights using OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano
   - Analyzes student data patterns
   - Creates predictive analytics and recommendations

4. **API Endpoint** (`src/app/api/ai-insights/route.ts`)
   - Handles real-time data processing
   - Manages insight generation and storage
   - Provides dashboard integration

## Data Flow & Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Collection
The system continuously collects data from multiple sources:

- **Assignment Progress** (`assignment_progress` table)
  - Completion rates, scores, accuracy, time spent
  - Status tracking (started, in_progress, completed)

- **Game Sessions** (`enhanced_game_sessions` table)
  - Game performance metrics
  - Session duration and engagement
  - Skill-specific performance data

- **Vocabulary Progress** (`student_vocabulary_assignment_progress` table)
  - Word-level mastery tracking
  - Retention rates and difficulty analysis
  - Individual vocabulary performance

- **Class Enrollments** (`class_enrollments` table)
  - Student-class relationships
  - Enrollment status and activity

### 2. Real-Time Analytics Processing

**Frequency**: Every 5 minutes (dashboard auto-refresh)
**Trigger**: Dashboard load, manual refresh, or scheduled background processing

**Process**:
1. `StudentDataService.getStudentAnalyticsData()` aggregates raw data
2. Risk indicators calculated in real-time:
   - Low average score (<60%)
   - Low accuracy (<70%)
   - Poor completion rate (<50%)
   - Infrequent activity (<2 sessions/week)
   - Poor vocabulary retention (<50%)

3. Class-level analytics computed:
   - At-risk student counts
   - Engagement scores
   - Common struggle patterns
   - Performance trends

### 3. AI Insight Generation

**When AI API is Called**:
- Dashboard initial load
- Every 5 minutes during active use
- When new critical patterns are detected
- Manual refresh requests

**OpenAI API Integration**:
- **Model**: GPT-4.1-nano (cost-effective, fast)
- **API Key**: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Usage**: Pattern analysis and recommendation generation
- **Frequency**: Controlled to minimize costs while maintaining real-time insights

**AI Analysis Process**:
1. Student data fed to `AIInsightsService.generateInsightsFromData()`
2. Risk patterns identified automatically
3. Confidence scores calculated (0.7-0.95 range)
4. Actionable recommendations generated
5. Insights stored in `ai_insights` database table
