# School Management System - Implementation Complete! ‚úÖ

## üéâ All Recommendations Implemented

I've successfully implemented ALL security and subscription recommendations from the analysis document. Here's what was done:

---

## üîí Security Implementation

### ‚úÖ 1. Invitation-Only System (IMPLEMENTED)

**Problem**: Teachers could join any school if they knew the school code.

**Solution**: Implemented strict invitation validation during signup.

**How it works**:
1. Teacher receives invitation email with signup link
2. During signup, system validates:
   - Pending invitation exists for that email + school code
   - Invitation hasn't expired (7-day expiry)
   - Invitation status is 'pending'
3. If no valid invitation ‚Üí **403 Forbidden** error with message:
   > "You must be invited by your school to join. Please contact your school administrator for an invitation."
4. After successful signup:
   - Invitation marked as 'accepted'
   - Teacher added to school_memberships
   - Teacher's profile updated with school_code and school_owner_id

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Added invitation validation logic
- `src/app/api/school/invite-teacher/route.ts` - Creates pending invitations
- Database migration: `add_pending_teacher_invitations` table

**Security Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ School owners have full control over who joins
- ‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ Tracks who invited whom
- ‚úÖ Invitation expiry prevents stale invitations

## üíé Subscription & Premium Access Implementation

### ‚úÖ 2. School-Wide Unlimited Teachers (IMPLEMENTED)

**Requirement**: All pricing plans (Standard ¬£399, Large ¬£699, MAT ¬£999) include unlimited teachers.

**Solution**: Implemented school-based subscription system with unlimited teacher seats.

**How it works**:
1. **School Subscription**: School owner purchases plan (Standard/Large/MAT)
2. **Automatic Premium Access**: ALL teachers in that school get premium features
3. **No Seat Limits**: Unlimited teachers can join
4. **Dual-Source Premium**: Teachers can have premium via:
   - Individual subscription (they paid themselves)
   - School subscription (school owner paid)

**Database Changes**:
```sql
-- Added to school_codes table:
- subscription_status (free/active/cancelled/past_due)
- subscription_plan (standard/large/mat)
- stripe_subscription_id
- subscription_start_date
- subscription_end_date
```

**Premium Access Logic**:
```typescript
// Check individual subscription first
if (user.subscription_status === 'active') {
  return { hasPremium: true, source: 'individual' };
}

// Check school subscription
if (user.school_code) {
  const school = getSchool(user.school_code);
  if (school.subscription_status === 'active') {
    return { hasPremium: true, source: 'school' };
  }
}

return { hasPremium: false };
```

**Files Created**:
- `src/lib/premium-access.ts` - Premium access utilities
- Database function: `has_premium_access(user_id)` - Server-side check

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` - Updated to check school subscriptions
- Database migration: `add_school_subscription_fields`

## üìä UI Improvements

### ‚úÖ 3. Pending Invitations Display (IMPLEMENTED)

**What was added**:
- Separate "Pending Invitations" section on school management page
- Shows teachers who have been invited but haven't signed up yet
- Displays:
  - Teacher name and email
  - Invitation sent date
  - Expiry date
  - "Pending" status badge
- Amber/yellow styling to differentiate from active members

**Visual Design**:
- Amber gradient header
- Separate from active members list
- Clear status indicators
- Expiry date warnings

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/account/school/page.tsx` - Added pending invitations UI
- `src/app/api/school/members/route.ts` - Returns pending invitations

## üìù Answers to Your Questions

### Q: "What is stopping a teacher knowing the school code of another school and signing up as a teacher?"

Teachers now MUST have a pending invitation to join a school. The signup process validates:

3. Invitation status is 'pending'

Without a valid invitation ‚Üí **403 Forbidden** error.

### Q: "Does it automatically give that teacher pro mode or not?"

**A**: ‚úÖ **YES - IF SCHOOL HAS SUBSCRIPTION!**
