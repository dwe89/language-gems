### Progress Tracking & Analytics

#### Personal Dashboard
- **Words Learned**: Total vocabulary mastered
- **Current Streak**: Consecutive days of practice
- **Weekly Progress**: Words practiced this week
- **Mastery Levels**: Detailed breakdown by topic/theme

#### Intelligent Progress Tracking
- **Mastery Levels**: 6-level system (Unknown ‚Üí Seen ‚Üí Practiced ‚Üí Learned ‚Üí Mastered ‚Üí Expert)
- **Weakness Identification**: Automatically identifies problematic words
- **Strength Recognition**: Tracks areas of excellence
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed insights into learning patterns

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Answer Quality Assessment
The system evaluates your responses on a 6-point scale:
- **Perfect (5)**: Instant, correct response
- **Easy (4)**: Quick, correct response
- **Good (3)**: Correct response with normal timing
- **Hard (2)**: Correct but slow response
- **Incorrect (1)**: Wrong answer
- **Blackout (0)**: No response or completely wrong

### Scoring System
- **Base Score**: 100 points per correct answer
- **Streak Bonus**: Up to 100 additional points for consecutive correct answers
- **Speed Bonus**: Extra points for quick responses in speed mode
- **Mastery Bonus**: Additional points for demonstrating mastery

### Dynamic Difficulty
- **Ease Factor**: Adjusts between 1.3-3.0 based on performance
- **Review Intervals**: Range from 1 day to several months
- **Automatic Reset**: Poor performance resets intervals for more frequent review

## üìä Spaced Repetition Science

### How It Works
1. **Initial Learning**: New words start with short intervals (1-6 days)
2. **Successful Reviews**: Intervals increase exponentially (6 days ‚Üí 2 weeks ‚Üí 1 month ‚Üí etc.)
3. **Failed Reviews**: Intervals reset to ensure adequate practice
4. **Long-term Retention**: Successfully learned words are reviewed at increasingly longer intervals

### Quality-Based Scheduling
Your response quality directly affects the next review date:
- **High Quality**: Longer intervals, less frequent reviews
- **Low Quality**: Shorter intervals, more frequent reviews
- **Consistent Performance**: Stable, predictable scheduling

## üéØ Integration with Dashboard

### Seamless Experience
- **Progress Sync**: All learning data syncs with your main dashboard
- **Weakness Tracking**: Identified weak areas appear in your analytics
- **Achievement System**: Earn badges and achievements for milestones

### Teacher Integration
- **Assignment Mode**: Teachers can assign specific vocabulary sets
- **Progress Monitoring**: Teachers can track student progress and identify struggling areas
- **Class Analytics**: Aggregate data shows class-wide performance trends
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Supports curriculum-based vocabulary lists
